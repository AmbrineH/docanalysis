<p>Anti-
 <italic>Helicobacter pylori </italic>effect of the essential oil was examined by an agar dilution method. 
 <italic>H. pylori </italic>strain RIGLD-HC180 obtained from antral biopsy samples of patients at Taleghani Hospital, Tehran, Iran was used in this study. 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic> was cultured on 
 <italic>Brucella</italic> agar (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, USA). The plates were incubated for 3 days at 37°C in microaerophilic conditions using Microbiology Anaerocult
 <sup>®</sup> C bags (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Anaerocult
 <sup>®</sup> C bags are used for production of an O
 <sub>2</sub> depleted and CO
 <sub>2</sub>- enriched atmosphere in an anaerobic jar. The bacterial suspension was prepared in sterile normal saline and adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standard (1.5 × 10
 <sup>8 </sup>CFU/mL). Different concentrations of the essential oil or thymol (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), the major constituent of the essential oil, were prepared in methanol. Serial dilutions of the essential oil or thymol were prepared in 
 <italic>Brucella</italic> agar supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum. This was done before solidifying the medium at 50 °C. After solidification, 10 μL of bacterial suspension was spread over the plates using a sterile loop. The plates were put into an anaerobic jar under microaerophilic conditions and incubated at 37 °C for 72 h as explained above. All samples were prepared in triplicate. The lowest concentrations of the essential oil or thymol that inhibited visible bacterial growth (containing no colonies) were expressed as minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Plates containing methanol and amoxicillin (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) (50 μg/mL) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively (

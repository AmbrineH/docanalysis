<p>MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and T47D (human breast cancer cell lines) were purchased from Pasture Institute of Iran, Tehran, Iran. Briefly, the cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (PAA, Germany) containing N-Hydroxyethylpiperazone-n-2-Ethanesulfonic Acid (HEPES, Biosera, England), sodium bicarbonate supplemented with 1% antibiotics (100 μg/mL streptomycin and 100 U/mL penicillin (Biosera, England)) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, USA). All three cell lines were incubated in air with 5% carbon dioxide at 37 °C. The cytotoxic activity of the essential oil was measured by the MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide)( Sigma-Aldrich, USA) assay with slight modification (

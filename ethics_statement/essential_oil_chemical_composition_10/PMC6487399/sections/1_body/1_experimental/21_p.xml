<p>The cell suspensions were seeded into 96-well plates and incubated at 37 Â°C in air with 5% CO2 overnight. Three different concentrations of 
 <italic>O. decumbens</italic> essential oil were added to wells and incubated for 24 h. The MTT reagent (5 mg/mL) and the media were added per well and incubated for 4 h. Then, the medium of each well was removed and DMSO was added into wells, and absorbance measured at 545 nm using a microplate reader. The wells containing DMSO and etoposide were applied as negative and positive controls. Finally, IC
 <sub>50</sub> (the required concentrations of the essential oil for inhibition of 50% of cell growth) values were calculated. All tests were replicated three times (

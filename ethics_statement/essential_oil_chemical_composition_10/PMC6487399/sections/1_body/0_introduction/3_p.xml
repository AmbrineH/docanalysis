<p>Previous studies of 
 <italic>O. decumbens</italic> essential oil reported thymol and carvacrol as the main constituents (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Moreover, the considerable antioxidant and antibacterial effects of the essential oil have been ascribed to the presence of phenolic compounds (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Thymol and carvacrol exhibit a wide spectrum of biological effects such as antibacterial (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), anti-
 <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and cytotoxic activities (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Both of components were shown to possess a strong toxic effect against the cabbage looper in a previous study (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). These compounds also showed considerable anticholinesterase activity although the relationship to their insecticidal effect is controversial (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Traditional background and pharmacological effects of major essential oil compounds of
 <italic> O. decumbens</italic> encouraged us to investigate its various biological activities, including antibacterial, anti-
 <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>, insecticidal, anti-cholinesterase and cytotoxic activities. Moreover, our sample of 
 <italic>O. decumbens </italic>essential oil, from plants collected at Kohgiluyeh va Boyer Ahmad Province, Iran was analyzed by GC/MS.

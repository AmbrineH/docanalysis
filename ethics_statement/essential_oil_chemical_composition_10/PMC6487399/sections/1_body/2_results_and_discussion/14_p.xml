 <italic>O. decumbens </italic>essential oil has significant insecticidal activity on 
 <italic>Trichoplusi ni</italic> via topical and fumigation application. Among its main constituents, myristicin, and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene have the most potent inhibitory effects against cabbage looper in topical and fumigation applications, respectively. Thymol and carvacrol as major constituents of the essential oil showed more potent toxicity on 
 <italic>T. ni</italic> when topically applied than via fumigation. According to other studies, thymol and carvacrol have strong toxicity against 
 <italic>Spodoptera litura</italic> and 
 <italic>Trichoplusi ni</italic> (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Similar to our results, there are reports that myristicin has an insecticidal effect against 
 <italic>T. ni</italic> when applied topically (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Additionally, the essential oil of 
 <italic>Helosciadium nodiflorum</italic> showed strong toxicity against 
 <italic>T. ni</italic> due to the presence of myristicin (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).

<p>This study highlighted that the 
 <italic>O. decumbens</italic> essential oil could exert a significant inhibitory effect on acetylcholinesterase. As shown in 
 <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>, the essential oil inhibited AChE activity at a low concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>= 0.117 ± 0.049 µg/mL), whereas the BuChE inhibitory activity was not observed even at higher concentrations (IC
 <sub>50</sub>&gt; 0.5
 <sup>*</sup> µg/m). Our results showed that 
 <italic>O. decumbens </italic>essential oil containing high proportions of thymol and carvacrol, possessed potent anti-AChE activity. According to previous studies, thymol and carvacrol individually have shown significant inhibitory activity against AChE (

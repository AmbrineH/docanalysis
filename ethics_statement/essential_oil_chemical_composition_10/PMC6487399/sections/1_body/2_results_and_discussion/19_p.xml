<p>The presence of phenolic components such as thymol and carvacrol could cause potent cytotoxic activity highlighted in the present investigation (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Both of these compounds are known to have significant cytotoxicity (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). According to 
 <xref rid="T7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>, cytotoxicity of the essential oil on the MDA-MB-231 cell line is 100 times greater than the activity of carvacrol individually (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), indicating toxicity from some other constituents of the 
 <italic>O. decumbens </italic>essential oil or the synergistic or additive effects of them on this human breast cancer cell line. Another investigation of cytotoxic activity of natural monoterpenes on different cancer cell lines pointed to carvacrol as the most potent cytotoxic agent on many cell lines such as MCF-7 (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Various results with thymol and carvacrol on different cell lines indicate that further investigation is required to find the mechanism of action for these two compounds individually and in combination on different cell lines.

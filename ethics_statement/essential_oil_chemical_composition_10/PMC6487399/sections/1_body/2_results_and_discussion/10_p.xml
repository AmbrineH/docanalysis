<p>We report significant anti-
 <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> activity of 
 <italic>O. decumbens</italic> essential oil. This is consistent with traditional uses of the herb for treating gastrointestinal disorders (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). A recent report mentioned that carvacrol possessed potent activity against 
 <italic>H. pylori </italic>whereas the presence of thymol decreased the anti-
 <italic>Helicobacter pylori </italic>effect of carvacrol (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Consistent with this recent publication, our study exhibited lower activity of thymol against 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic> compared to the intact essential oil (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Hence, further investigation is required to pinpoint the active principle behind the anti-
 <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> effects of this essential oil.

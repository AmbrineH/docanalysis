 <caption>
  <p>Lineweaver-Burk plot of α-glucosidase inhibition at different substrate [S] concentrations in absence (○) or presence of various concentrations (●: 7.5 μg/mL; ▲: 15 μg/mL and ■: 30 μg/mL) of RaEO. Insert: Secondary replot of Y-intercept against inhibitor concentrations to calculate the inhibition constant (Ki). Each point is the average value from three independent experiments</p>

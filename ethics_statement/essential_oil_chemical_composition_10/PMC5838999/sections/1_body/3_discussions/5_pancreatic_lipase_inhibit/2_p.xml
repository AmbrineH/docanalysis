<p id="Par67">Using the method A (preincubation of lipase with inhibitor), the RaEO exhibited promising anti-lipase activity which is comparable with that of pure THL used as a standard inhibitor against pancreatic lipase. In the same way and according to the literature, the inhibition of pancreatic lipase by the essential oil of 
 <italic>Salvia judaica</italic> (Lamiaceae) flowers was determined colorimetrically and compared with Orlistat used as a positive control by Afifi et al. [

 <sub>50</sub> value (0.108 mg/mL) obtained in this study was very close to that obtained with RaEO (0.2 mg/mL). In this work, similarly to our essential oil, the aroma profile of the 
 <italic>Salvia judaica</italic> (Lamiaceae) flowers was found to be mainly composed by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (71.8%).

<p id="Par62">Despite the many publications on the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils for the 
 <italic>Rhaponticum</italic> genus, little information is available about their antioxidant activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Therefore, this is the first report about the antioxidant activity of the essential oil of 
 <italic>R. acaule</italic>. Overall, according to the three tests used in this study (ABTS radical scavenging activity, Reducing power and Phosphomolybdenum assay), the obtained antioxidant activity of the RaEO might be attributed to the presence of high percentages of mainly germacrene D (49.2 ± 1.1%), methyl eugenol (8.3 ± 0.28%), (E)-β-ionone (6.2 ± 0.18%) and β-caryophyllene (5.7 ± 0.17%) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Similarly to our results, some works reported that several essential oils having low phenolic compounds amounts also exhibits interesting antioxidant capacity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. However, it’s difficult to correlate the antioxidant activity of a total essential oil to one or few active compounds. Both minor and major compounds should make a significant contribution to the activity of the oil.

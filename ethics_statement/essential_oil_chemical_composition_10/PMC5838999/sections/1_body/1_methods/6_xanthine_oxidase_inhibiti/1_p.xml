<p id="Par37">Xanthine oxidase activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 295 nm by continuously measuring uric acid formation, according to the protocol of Kong et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The reaction mixture is composed of 250 μL of test solution, 300 μL of 70 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and 300 μL of substrate solution (150 μM xanthine in the same buffer). After preincubation at 25 °C during 15 min, the reaction was triggered by the addition of 150 μL enzyme solution (0.1 units/mL in 70 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) freshly prepared before use. Pure control having 100% enzyme activity was conducted by replacing the essential oil with DMSO. Blank for pure control having 0% enzyme activity was conducted with DMSO and by replacing the enzyme with buffer. Allopurinol was used as a positive control. The RaEO was tested for xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity at various concentrations. Each sample was carried out in triplicate. The inhibitory activity was determined by IC
 <sub>50</sub>, which was obtained from percent inhibition calculated by the following equation:

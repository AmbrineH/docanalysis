<p id="Par28">The RaEO reducing power was evaluated using the method described by Oyaizu [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The essential oil concentrations ranged from 0.3 to 10 mg/mL. Aliquot of 1 mL essential oil dissolved in methanol was mixed with 1 mL of 200 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.6) and 1 mL (1%) of potassium ferricyanide [K
 <sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)
 <sub>6</sub>]. The obtained mixture was incubated at 50 °C for 20 min, and then acidified with 1 mL of trichloroacetic acid (10%). At the last step, 0.25 mL of FeCl
 <sub>3</sub> (0.1%) were added to this solution. Distilled water was used as blank and for control. Using UV spectrophotometer, absorption of this mixture was measured at 700 nm. Increased absorbance of the mixture designates the sample ferric reducing power capability. The essential oil providing 0.5 of absorbance (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated using the absorbance graph of at 700 nm against essential oil concentration. Trolox was used as a positive control. The obtained values are presented as the means of triplicate assay.

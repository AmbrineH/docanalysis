<p id="Par22">Analytical GC: essential oil composition was established by gas chromatograph: HP 5890-series II equipped with flame ionization detectors (FID), HP-5 (30 m × 0.25 mm ID, 0.52 μm film thickness) fused silica capillary column, carrier gas nitrogen (1.2 mL/min). The temperature oven was programmed from 50 °C (1 min) to 280 °C at 5 °C/min (1 min). Injector and detector temperatures were 250 °C and 280 °C, respectively. 0.1 μL of 1% hexane solution was injected. The identification of the different components was carried out when comparing their retention times with those of pure authentic samples and by mean of their linear retention indices (L.R.I) relative to the series of

<p id="Par18">Therefore, the goal of this study was to establish the chemical composition, the antioxidant effects of the essential oil of 
 <italic>R. acaule</italic> collected in a very different habitat of Tunisia and its inhibitory power against Î±-glucosidase, xanthine oxidase and pancreatic lipase. Enzyme kinetic studies using Michaelis-Menten and the derived Lineweaver-Burk (LB) plots were performed to understand the possible mechanism of inhibition exercised by the components of this essential oil.

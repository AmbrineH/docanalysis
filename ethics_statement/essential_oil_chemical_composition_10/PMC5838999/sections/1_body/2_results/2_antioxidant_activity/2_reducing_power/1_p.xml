<p id="Par49">The reducing capacity of products is an important indicator of their antioxidant effect because it evaluates the ability of the sample to donate hydrogen atoms and to interfere with the free-radical chain reaction [

 <sup>3+</sup> to Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> was conducted. Our results show that the reducing capacity increased with the essential oil concentration in a dose-dependent manner with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.604 ± 0.021 mg/mL (Table

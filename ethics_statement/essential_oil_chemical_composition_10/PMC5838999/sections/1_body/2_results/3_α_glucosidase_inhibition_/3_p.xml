<p id="Par54">Moreover, from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, it can be noted that the intersecting lines on the graph converge at the left side of the Y-axis and above the X-axis, indicating that the value of α (a constant that defines the degree to which inhibitor binding affects the affinity of the enzyme for substrate) is greater than 1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This confirms that the inhibitor prefers binding to the free enzyme rather than to the enzyme substrate complex. Therefore, the mode of inhibition caused by the essential oil is a mixed-type one, but it seems that it has strong competitive components. The inhibition constant (Ki) value derived from the secondary plot (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) was 37.5 μg/mL.

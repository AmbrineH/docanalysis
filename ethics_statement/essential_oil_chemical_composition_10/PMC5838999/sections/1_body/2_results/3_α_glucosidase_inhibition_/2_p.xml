<p id="Par53">To investigate the type of enzyme inhibition and to determine the inhibition constant (Ki), the kinetics was performed according to the procedure detailed in the Materials and Methods section. The Lineweaverâ€“Burk plots analysis indicated that the lines coincided on a point on the left side of the 
 <italic>Y</italic>-axis and intercepted both the 
 <italic>Y</italic>- and the 
 <italic>X</italic>-axes at different points. What can be also observed are a decrease in apparent V
 <sub>max</sub> value and an increase in the value of apparent K
 <sub>m</sub>, indicating that the nature of inhibition is of mixed-type (Fig.
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

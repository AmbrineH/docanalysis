<p id="Par52">According to literature, few reports exist for the inhibition activity of α-glucosidase by essential oils. The low IC
 <sub>50</sub> values obtained in this assay indicated a high inhibition activity. From our results, RaEO shows interesting antidiabetic activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 6.7 ± 0.10 μg/mL which is 42-fold lower than that of the commercial inhibitor acarbose (280 ± 10.01 μg/mL).

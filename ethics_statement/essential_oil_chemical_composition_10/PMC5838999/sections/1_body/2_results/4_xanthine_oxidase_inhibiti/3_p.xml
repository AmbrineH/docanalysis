 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) was 10 μg/mL, indicating that this essential oil tended to bind more easily to the xanthine oxidase. Indeed, smaller value of inhibition constant indicates stronger inhibition, which explains that the inhibitor-enzyme binding affinity exceeds the binding affinity of the enzyme-substrate.

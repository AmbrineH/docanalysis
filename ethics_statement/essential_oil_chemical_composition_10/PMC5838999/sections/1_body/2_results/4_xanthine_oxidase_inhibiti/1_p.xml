<p id="Par55">The RaEO was tested for xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity at various concentrations and thereafter the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value was deduced. It can be observed that this essential oil has a very interesting IC
 <sub>50</sub> value (2.20 ± 0.10 μg/mL), which is comparable to that of the reference compound, allopurinol (2.6 ± 0.16 μg/mL).

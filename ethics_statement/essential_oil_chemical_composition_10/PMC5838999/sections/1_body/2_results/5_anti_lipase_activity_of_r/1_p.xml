<p id="Par58">In this work, TPL was used to measure the anti-lipase activity of RaEO. This enzyme was totally purified and its relation structureâ€“function is previously determined [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. These authors showed that the biochemical properties and structures of TPL are similar to those of mammals. For this reason, TPL was used instead of the mammalian one. The anti-lipase activity of the essential oil was conducted using two methods, which differ in the order of the inhibitor addition.

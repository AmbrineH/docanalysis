<p id="Par56">In the present work, we reported the phytochemical and biological properties of Tunisian essential oil from flowers of 
 <italic>Cirus limon</italic>. The chemical composition of 
 <italic>Cl</italic>EO revealed that limonene and Î²-Pinene were the main components. We also demonstrated, in vitro and in situ, the efficiency of 
 <italic>Cl</italic>EO as a natural antioxidant and antimicrobial agent. In this regard, beef meat including 
 <italic>Cl</italic>EO is an interesting target during refrigerated storage as contamination of beef meat by food spoilage and food-borne pathogens is considered one of the major problems to the progress of food industry.

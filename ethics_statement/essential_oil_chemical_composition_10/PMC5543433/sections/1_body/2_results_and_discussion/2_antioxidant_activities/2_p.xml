<p id="Par44">The inhibitory effect of the different 
 <italic>Cl</italic>EO concentrations on lipid peroxidation was determined by the β-carotene/linoleic acid bleaching test. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> showed a various degree of the linoleic acid oxidation and subsequently the β-carotene bleaching after addition of the 
 <italic>Cl</italic>EO and the BHT used as positive control at different concentrations. This antioxidant activity of the 
 <italic>Cl</italic>EO was increased with the increasing concentration (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). Overall results were better than those provided by the radical-scavenging activity (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In fact, 
 <italic>Cl</italic>EO displayed an excellent DPPH scavenging ability with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 15.056 μg/ml and a strong β-carotene bleaching inhibition after 120 min of incubation with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 40.147 μg/ml (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The inhibition of lipid peroxidation by addition of 
 <italic>Cl</italic>EO could be used to improve the quality and stability of food products. 
 <italic>Cl</italic>EO was able to quenching peroxide radicals and to terminate the peroxidation chain reaction.

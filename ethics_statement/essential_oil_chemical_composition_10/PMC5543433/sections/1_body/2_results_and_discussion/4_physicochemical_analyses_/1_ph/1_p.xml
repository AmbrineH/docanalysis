<p id="Par52">The data presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> indicate the pH evolution in raw minced beef meat treated with four different treatments. The initial pH recorded for the control and the treated samples was above 5.6. The pH value of (C) was found to raise from 5.66 ± 0.26 to 7.0 ± 0.24 at the end of storage period. Compared with control sample, no significant differences were found concerning pH value of T
 <sub>1,</sub> T2 and T
 <sub>3</sub> samples. Statistically, this difference of pH became significant (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) from the sample T
 <sub>4</sub>. At the end of storage, pH values of raw minced meat were affected (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) by the addition of preservatives. The pH rise (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) reflects the degree of meat spoilage through protein breakdown for the production of free amino acids leading to the formation of NH
 <sub>3</sub> and amines, compounds of alkaline reaction [

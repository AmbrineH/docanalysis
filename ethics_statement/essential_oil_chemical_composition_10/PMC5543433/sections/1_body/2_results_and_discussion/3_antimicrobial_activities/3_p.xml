<p id="Par49">The antifungal activity was evaluated against 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> sp. and 
 <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic>. Results showed a strong inhibitory effect of 
 <italic>Cl</italic>EO on the growth of 
 <italic>A. niger</italic> and 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> with inhibition zone diameters of 26 mm and MIC values of 0.625 and 0.312 mg/ml respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Also, the 
 <italic>Cl</italic>EO exhibited an antifungal activity against 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> sp. and 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> sp., which are responsible for spoilage of many foods. The maximal inhibition zone diameters were 17–21 mm and MIC values ranged from 0.625 to 1.25 mg/ml (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The high antifungal activity may be attributed to the presence of the said chemical components in the essential oil. The antimicrobial activity of the essential oils of 
 <italic>C. limon</italic> apparently related to its terpenes type components such as pinene, myrcene and limonene (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), since there is a relationship between the chemical structures of the most abundant oils and their antimicrobial activities. Limonene has been shown to have strong antifungal properties [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The essential oils containing terpenes are also reported to possess antimicrobial activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], which are consistent with our present studies.

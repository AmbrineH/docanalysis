<p id="Par50">Although the different compounds exhibited varying degrees of antifungal activity, β-caryophyllene and caryophyllene oxide were very fungitoxic against the studied Fusarium species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Another minor monoterpene alcohol, linalool, is reported to have a wide range of antibacterial and antifungal activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Enatiomers of α-pinene, 2-β-pinene and limonene have a strong antibacterial activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. These chemical components exert their toxic effects against studied microorganisms through the disruption of bacteria or fungal membrane integrity [

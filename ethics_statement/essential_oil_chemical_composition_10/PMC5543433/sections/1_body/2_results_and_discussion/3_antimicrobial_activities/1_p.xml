<p id="Par47">The antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>C. limon</italic> essential oil was evaluated against Gram + positive (
 <italic>B. cereus, E. faecalis, S. aureus, S. epidermis, B. subtilis, L. monocytogenes</italic> and 
 <italic>M. luteus</italic>) and Gram-negative (
 <italic>P. aeruginosa, E.coli, S. enteritidis</italic> and 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>) bacteria. The antibacterial activity was assessed by evaluating the inhibition zone (IZ) and the determination of MIC values. As can be seen in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, 
 <italic>Cl</italic>EO showed varying degrees of antibacterial activity against all strains tested. The inhibition zones were in the range of 13–26 mm. Among Gram positive bacteria, highest inhibitory zone was observed against 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> (26 mm) followed by 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> (24 mm) and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (22 mm). Among Gram negative, highest inhibitory zone was observed against 
 <italic>S. enteritidis</italic> (18 mm). The inhibition zone for Gentamicin (10 μg/well), which was used as positive controls for bacteria, ranged from 12 to 25 mm. Negative control did not show any inhibitory effect against the tested bacteria.

<p id="Par22">Foods contaminated with 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli</italic> O157:H7 and 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> has been reported as the causal agents of foodborne diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. One of the most important psychrotrophic food pathogens related to anaerobically packed cooked meat products and shelf-life failures of conserved foods is 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>. This organism is the causal agent of listeriosis, a disease that can be serious and is often fatal in susceptible individuals, caused by eating contaminated food [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Thus, to prevent contamination during the production, sale and distribution and to extend the shelf life time of raw and/or processed foods, synthetic additives should be used. However, there is a strong debate about the safety aspects of these chemical preservatives since they are considered responsible for many carcinogenic and teratogenic attributes as well as residual toxicity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Thus, a growing attention is being paid to plants and herbs naturally derived compounds as a new alternative to prevent the proliferation of microorganism and protect food from oxidation. Generally, little information exists on the in vivo antimicrobial efficacy of plant essential oils against food-borne pathogens in meat. To the best of our knowledge, the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>Citrus limon</italic> essential oil (
 <italic>Cl</italic>EO) against a wide range of food-associated microorganisms (bacteria, moulds, and yeasts) has not been studied. The purposes of the present work were (i) to evaluate the chemical composition of Tunisian lemon EO (
 <italic>Cl</italic>EO) by GC-MS, (ii) to study in vitro the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of 
 <italic>Cl</italic>EO, (iii) to assess the effect of 
 <italic>Cl</italic>EO on physicochemical of raw minced beef meat stored at 4 °C, and (iv) to determine the efficacy of 
 <italic>Cl</italic>EO in inhibiting 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> growth in raw minced beef meat during refrigerated storage.

<p id="Par35">The in situ efficacy of the 
 <italic>Cl</italic>EO was evaluated against 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in minced beef meat model according to the procedure described by Ben Hsouna et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and Careaga et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] with slight modifications. Briefly, a fresh working culture of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> containing about 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/ml was prepared by suspending 3–5 isolated colonies in 10 ml of Mueller-Hinton broth (MH) and was cultured overnight at 37 °C for 24 h to reach the stationary phase. Freshly post-rigor lean beef muscles were obtained from a slaughterhouse in Sfax-Tunisia and transported to the laboratory in insulated polystyrene boxes on ice within 1 h of the chopping process. A healthy and freshly slaughtered animal has its muscle sterile [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In order to reduce the number of microorganisms attached to the surface of beef muscle, each piece was immersed in boiling water for 5 min. The cooked surface of the muscle was eliminated with sterile knives under aseptic conditions. The pieces of meat prepared as described above were minced in a sterile grinder, and portions of 25 ± 0.1 g were placed in bags. Half of the meat samples were inoculated with 2 × 10
 <sup>2</sup> CFU of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>/g of meat and mixed homogeneously for 3 min at room temperature to ensure proper distribution of the pathogen. Before inoculation of the second half of meat, the 
 <italic>Cl</italic>EO was dissolved in 10% DMSO, filtered through 0.22 μm pore-size black polycarbonate filters (Millipore) and was then added two concentrations of 2MIC and 3MIC corresponding to 0.06 and 0.312 mg of 
 <italic>Cl</italic>EO/g of meat, respectively; and mixed to evenly distribute the microorganisms. All bags containing the samples of meat were stored at 7 °C and examined at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 days of storage for 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> enumeration. After predetermined intervals, the 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> isolation was done by removing the pieces aseptically and blending with 250 ml of MH. The samples were homogenized for 1 min, and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. From this pre-enrichment (for the resuscitation of possible injured living cells), the remaining 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> was determined by the plate colony count technique. After serial 10-fold dilution technique with physiological saline solution, 100 μl of each sample were spread onto surfaces of the Muller Hinton agar medium followed by incubation at 37 °C for 24 h. Sterile saline water was added in the untreated control instead of 
 <italic>Cl</italic>EO, inoculated with the test bacteria and stored under the same conditions as the other samples. Three individual replicates of each experiment were performed, in all cases.

<p id="Par36">Raw meat beef was provided by a local supplier (slaughterhouse of Sfax, Tunisia). They were placed in insulated polystyrene boxes on ice and transferred to the laboratory within 1 h of slaughtering. Raw meat beef was raw minced by grinding in a sterile grinder. Concerning the conditioning of raw minced beef for storage at 4 °C studies, five equal portions (C, T1- T4): C (Control), T
 <sub>1</sub> (
 <italic>Cl</italic>EO: 0.06%), T
 <sub>2</sub> (
 <italic>Cl</italic>EO: 0.312%), T
 <sub>3</sub> (BHT at 0.01%), T
 <sub>4</sub> (
 <italic>Cl</italic>EO 0.312% and BHT at 0.01%). For each experiment, all runs were applied to a single batch of raw minced beef meat. Each formulation produced one mixture homogeneous which was vacuum stuffed into plastic casings to produce three ‘replicates’.

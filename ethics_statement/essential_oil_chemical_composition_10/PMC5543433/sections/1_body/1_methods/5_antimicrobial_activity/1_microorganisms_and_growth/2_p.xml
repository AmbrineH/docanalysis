<p id="Par32">The following fungal strains were also tested:

 <italic>, Aspergillus flavus</italic> (food isolate)
 <italic>, Aspergillus nidulans</italic> (food isolate), 
 <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> (food isolate),

 <italic>, Fusarium culmorum</italic> (ISPAVE 21w) and 
 <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic> (CTM 10230)
 <italic>.</italic> The bacterial strains were grown on Mueller Hinton broth (Bio-Rad, France) at 37 °C for 12–14 h while potato dextrose agar (PDA) (1.5% agar) at 28 °C for 4 days were used for fungi. Inocula were prepared from an overnight broth culture by their dilution in saline solution to approximately 10
 <sup>7</sup> colony-forming units (CFU)/ml for bacteria and 10
 <sup>5</sup> spores/ml for fungus.

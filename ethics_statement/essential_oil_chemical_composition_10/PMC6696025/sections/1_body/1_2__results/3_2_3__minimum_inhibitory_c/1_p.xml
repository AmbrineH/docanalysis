 <sub>GEN</sub> = 1.56 µg/mL), followed by 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (MIC

 <italic>A. bohemicus</italic> (MIC
 <sub>LEO</sub> = 0.47%, MIC
 <sub>GEN</sub> = 0.08 µg/mL). No bacterial growth occurred in the sterility control, while regular growth was recorded in the negative control. In all strains tested, DMSO antibacterial activity was not present for the MIC
 <sub>LEO</sub> concentrations used.

<p>The VPT used to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the LEO vapour phase is shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02701-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. After 24 h of incubation time, differing results emerged: For 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>, the MIC was higher than 40 µL whereas 
 <italic>K. marina</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> recorded an MIC of 20 µL. 
 <italic>A. bohemicus</italic> recorded the lowest level, with an MIC of 2 µL. After seven days the plates were checked to evaluate the bactericidal and bacteriostatic activity. No differences were found in 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> compared with the previous check, recording an MBC of 20 µL and more than 40 µL, respectively; moreover in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>K. marina,</italic> colonies were found in the 2 and 20 µL treatments while MBC was 40 µL. In 
 <italic>A. bohemicus</italic>, the MBC was 20 µL.

<p>MBC is expressed as the lowest concentration of essential oil where no visible growth on agar occurred. LEO tested on the G
 <sup>+</sup> group displayed a bacteriostatic effect, while on the G
 <sup>âˆ’</sup> group it recorded results that were consistent with the MIC data recorded before: 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> showed an MBC of 7.50%, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> was 1.87%, and 
 <italic>A. bohemicus</italic> was 0.47%; higher values of both MIC and MBC were obtained by using gen as a positive control (

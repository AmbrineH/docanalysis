<p>GC–MS analysis of the liquid phase showed the presence of 26 compounds (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02701-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), of which 89.2% were monoterpenoids and 3.1% were sesquiterpenoids The most abundant components were linalool (41.6%) and linalyl acetate (23.0%), followed by 1,8-cineole (5.2%) and terpinen-4-ol (4.8%). Lavandulyl acetate (3.2%) and borneol (2.8%) were identified as minor compounds. Headspace GC–MS analysis revealed different results. The percentages of the most volatile compounds increased while that of the highest boiling compounds decreased as shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02701-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. All the lower boiling compounds showed a greater abundance. More specifically, α-pinene increased to 8.7% and 1,8-cineole reached 19.8%. In contrast, compounds eluted subsequently from the chromatographic column recorded a decrease in their abundance compared to the analysis of the liquid phase. For example, linalool decreased to 35.8%, linalyl acetate to 7.5%, and terpinen-4-ol to 2.9%.

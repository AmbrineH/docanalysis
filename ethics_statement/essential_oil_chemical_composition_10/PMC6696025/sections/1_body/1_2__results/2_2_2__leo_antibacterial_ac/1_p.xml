<p>The antibacterial activity of LEO was assessed according to the inhibition zone diameter (halo) and the results obtained are summarised in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02701-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. In the G
 <sup>−</sup> group, an inhibition halo of 8.5 ± 0.7 mm was measured for 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>, while relative antibiotic control using gentamicin (gen) was 25.5 ± 0.7 mm; 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> showed an inhibition halo of 13 ± 1.41 mm (gen = 16.5 ± 2.12 mm) whereas 
 <italic>A. bohemicus</italic> exhibited a halo of 47 ± 4.24 mm (gen = 34.5 ± 0.7 mm). In the G
 <sup>+</sup> group tested, the 
 <italic>K. marina</italic> inhibition halo was 14.5 ± 2.12 mm (gen = 27 ± 2.83 mm) and that for 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> was 21.5 ± 0.7 mm (gen = 28.5 ± 0.7 mm).

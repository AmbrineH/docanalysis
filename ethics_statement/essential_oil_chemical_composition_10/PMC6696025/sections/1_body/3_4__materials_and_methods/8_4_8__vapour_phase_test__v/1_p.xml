<p>The antibacterial activity of LEO vapour phase was evaluated by the modified disk volatisation methods [

 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL was inoculated in the medium. Different aliquots of LEO were put in a 6 mm sterile disk: 40, 20, and 2 ÂµL. A negative control was prepared with a plate without LEO. Liquid LB agar was put in the space between the cover and the base of the Petri dishes to facilitate the sealing. During the solidification time, the Petri dishes were sealed with the aid of an adhesive tape to hold the edges of the plate with its respective counterpart to prevent any LEO leakage. The dishes were put into a plastic bag and incubated for 24 h. After the incubation time, the presence or absence of microbes was visually evaluated and the plates were checked after seven days to investigate the bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity. All VPTs were carried out in triplicate.

<p>The MIC is the lowest concentration of antimicrobial agent that completely inhibits growth of the organism in microdilution wells as detected by the unaided eye [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-24-02701" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. MIC values were determined according to the microwell dilution method [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-24-02701" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], with small adjustments. Briefly, 96-microplate wells were prepared by adding 12 dilutions of LEO in Lysogeny broth, from 7.5% to 0.0037%, a growth control without treatments, a control with the same percentage (from 5% to 0.002%) of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) used to solubilise LEO in an aqueous medium, a positive control with gentamicin diluted from 100 to 0.049 µg, and a sterility control without bacteria. In all wells, except for the sterility control, 50 µL of inoculum, previously diluted from 10
 <sup>8</sup> to 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL, were added and the plates were incubated for 20 h. To better visualise the inhibition activity, 20 µL of a solution 200 µg/mL of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) were added. The assay was carried out in triplicate.

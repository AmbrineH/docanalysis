<p>The volatile constituents were analysed by a PerkinElmer Inc., Headspace Turbomatrix 40 autosampler coupled to GC and GC–MS (Waltham, MA, USA). [

 <xref rid="B39-molecules-24-02701" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The procedures were optimised. The gas phase of the sealed vials was equilibrated for 20 min at 60 °C and was followed immediately by compound desorption into the GC injector in splitless mode. Quantification of compounds was performed by GC-FID under the same conditions described above.

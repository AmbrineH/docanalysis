<p>Fresh bacterial strains were suspended in Lysogeny Broth (LB preparation: 10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, 10 g NaCl per litre, autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min) to obtain a turbidity of 0.5 McFarland (approximately 10
 <sup>8</sup> Colony Forming Unit/mL—CFU/mL) and then seeded on LB agar. Sterile disks (6 mm diameter) were placed on the agar and impregnated with 10 µL of pure LEO. As a positive control, 2 µL of gentamicin from a stock solution (10 mg/mL) was used.

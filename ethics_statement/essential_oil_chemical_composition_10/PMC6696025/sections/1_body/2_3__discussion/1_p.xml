<p>LEO liquid and vapour phases were investigated by HS-GC/MS analysis and the presence of monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids were highlighted. The most abundant components were linalool and linalyl acetate followed by eucalyptol and terpinen-4-ol, while lavandulyl acetate and borneol were identified as minor compounds. These molecules are mainly responsible for lavandin’s characteristic flavour and for their biological and therapeutic properties [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-02701" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Depending on the different types of lavandin, variations in the chemical composition were found. Ghelardini et al. (1999) [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-02701" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] described the chemical composition of 
 <italic>L. angustifolia</italic> essential oil of Italian origin, characterised by linalool (31.5%), linalyl acetate (43.0%), and β-caryophyllene (5.0%) as the main compounds. Caputo et al. (2016) [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-02701" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] analysed 
 <italic>L. angustifolia</italic> essential oil obtained from the hydrodistillation of the plant grown in Salerno (Campania, Italy) and showed a composition rich in linalool (33.1%) and linalyl acetate (10.4%) and with low percentages of minor compounds. Iranian lavandin was characterised by 1,8-cineole (47.9%) as its main component followed by borneol (26.4%) and camphor (14.4%) [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-02701" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] (Bajalan et al. 2017), while Romanian lavandin essential oil was richer in camphor and 1,8-cineole [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-02701" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The essential lavender oil grown in India consisted of linalool (28.06%) and linalyl acetate (47.5%) [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-02701" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The major compounds of a 
 <italic>Lavandula</italic> hybrid grown in Northern Italy were linalyl acetate and borneol, which together accounted for 70% [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-02701" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In our study, the sum of these two compounds did not exceed 25.8% and LEO revealed a high content of linalool (41.6%), while linalyl acetate reached 23.0%; 1,8-cineole (5.2%) and camphor (6.0%) were present as secondary compounds. A previous study carried out on the same type of lavandin grown in Tuscany, Italy, [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-24-02701" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] reported that linalyl acetate amounted to 14.7%, 1,8-cineole 7.8%, and camphor 7.7%. All these variations in the percentages of the compounds detected could be either due to the cultivation area’s altitude or its microclimate. As for the quality of the LEO obtained, the component amounts found were in line with the levels accepted by the European Pharmacopeia (EPh) (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02701-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Only linalyl acetate was slightly below the limits set by EPh.

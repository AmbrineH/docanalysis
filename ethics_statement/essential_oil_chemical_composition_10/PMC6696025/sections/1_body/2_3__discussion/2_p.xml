<p>The results obtained from the different tests on bacteria showed that 
 <italic>A. bohemicus</italic> was the more sensitive strain to LEO with an inhibition halo of 47 mm and an MIC of 0.47% in the broth microdilution test, followed by 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> with a halo of 21.5 mm and an MIC of 0.94%. 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>K. marina</italic> showed similar values, both as regards the disk diffusion test (13.0 and 14.5 mm, respectively) and the microdilution test (both 1.87%). 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> proved to be the most resistant of all bacteria tested with an inhibition halo of 8.5 mm and an MIC of 3.75%. As seen in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02701-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, the MBC values showed bactericidal activity of LEO at the MIC concentration for 
 <italic>A. bohemicus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, while for 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> the MIC increased to 7.5%. This bactericidal effect occurred only for the G
 <sup>−</sup> bacteria, while for the G
 <sup>+</sup> bacteria bacteriostatic effects were observed, contributing to the formation of colonies after inhibition agent removal (results of the agar diffusion test are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02701-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Furthermore, in the VPT, 
 <italic>A. bohemicus</italic> proved the most sensitive to LEO treatments with an MIC lower than the minimum concentration used for the test; 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>K. marina</italic> recorded an identical MIC, varying slightly from the data previously obtained in the liquid phase. 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> achieved an MIC higher than the maximum concentration tested, 40 µL.

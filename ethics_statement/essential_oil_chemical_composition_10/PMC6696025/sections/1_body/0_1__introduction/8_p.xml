<p>In the present study, we have analysed the chemical composition of the liquid and vapour phase of 
 <italic>L. × intermedia</italic> cv. “Grosso” essential oil (LEO) grown in the Lazio Region, Italy, investigated by headspace coupled to gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (HS-GC/MS). We further studied LEO’s antimicrobial properties against gram-negative bacteria (G
 <sup>−</sup>) (
 <italic>Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter bohemicus,</italic> and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic>) and gram-positive bacteria (G

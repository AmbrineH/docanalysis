<p>EOs, particularly abundant in aromatic plants, play a fundamental role in plant protection against pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, and insects. Furthermore, they attract some insects to allow the fertilization process by pollen and seed dispersion [

 <xref rid="B9-molecules-24-02701" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. They are a hydrophobic complex mixture of volatile compounds and are mainly composed of terpenes biogenerated by the mevalonate pathway. These volatile molecules include monoterpenes (hydrocarbon and oxygenated monoterpens), and sesquiterpenes (hydrocarbon and oxygenated sesquiterpens) [

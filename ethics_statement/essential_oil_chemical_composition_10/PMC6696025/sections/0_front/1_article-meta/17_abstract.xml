 <p>Essential oils from 
  <italic>Lavandula</italic> genus and the obtained hybrids are widely used for different purposes such as perfume production in the cosmetic field and for its biological properties. This is the first study on the liquid and vapour phase of 
  <italic>Lavandula × intermedia</italic> “Grosso” essential oil grown in the Lazio Region, Italy, investigated using headspace coupled to gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (HS-GC/MS). The results showed the most abundant components were linalool and linalyl acetate, followed by 1,8-cineole and terpinen-4-ol, while lavandulyl acetate and borneol were identified as minor compounds, maintaining the same proportion in both the liquid and vapour phase. Furthermore, we tested lavandin liquid and vapour phase essential oil on gram-negative bacteria (
  <italic>Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter bohemicus,</italic> and 
  <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic>) and gram-positive bacteria (
  <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> and 
  <italic>Kocuria marina</italic>).

by means of increased microbial cell density that supports horizontal gene transfer across cells. The prevention of biofilm formation and the treatment of existing biofilms is currently a difficult challenge; therefore, the discovery of new multi-targeted or combinatorial therapies is growing. The development of anti-bio\ufb01lm agents is considered of major interest and represents a key strategy as non-biocidal molecules are highly valuable to avoid the rapid appearance of escape mutants. Among bacteria, staphylococci are predominant causes of biofilm-associated infections. Staphylococci, especially Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is an extraordinarily versatile pathogen that can survive in hostile environmental conditions, colonize mucous membranes and skin, and can cause severe, non-purulent, toxin-mediated diseases or invasive pyogenic infections in humans. Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) has also emerged as an important opportunistic pathogen in infections associated with medical devices (such as urinary and intravascular catheters, orthopaedic implants, etc.), causing approximately from 30% to 43% of joint prosthesis infections. The scientific community is continuously looking for new agents endowed of anti-biofilm capabilities to fight S. aureus and S epidermidis infections. Interestingly, several reports indicated in vitro efficacy of non-biocidal essential oils (EOs) as promising treatment to reduce bacterial biofilm production and prevent the inducing of drug resistance. In this report were analyzed 89 EOs with the objective of investigating their ability to modulate bacterial biofilm production of different S. aureus and S. epidermidis strains. Results showed the assayed EOs to modulated the biofilm production with unpredictable results for each strain. In particular, many EOs acted mainly as biofilm inhibitors in the case of S. epidermidis strains, while for S. aureus strains, EOs induced either no effect or stimulate biofilm production. In order to elucidate the obtained experimental results, machine learning (ML) algorithms were applied to the EOs' chemical compositions and the determined associated anti-biofilm potencies. Statistically robust ML models were developed, and their analysis in term of feature importance and partial dependence plots led to indicating those chemical components mainly responsible for biofilm production, inhibition or stimulation for each studied strain, respectively.", "affiliation": "Rome Center for Molecular Design, Department of Drug Chemistry and Technology, Sapienza University, P.le Aldo Moro 5, 00185 Rome, Italy. alexandros.patsilinakos@uniroma1.it.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": {"grantId": "FAR2018", "agency": "Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Ferrara", "orderIn": "0"}}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Humans"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Biofilms", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "DE", "qualifierName": "drug effects", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Staphylococcus", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "DE", "qualifierName": "drug effects", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}, {"abbreviation": "GD", "qualifierName": "growth & development", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "PY", "qualifierName": "pathogenicity", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Staphylococcal Infections", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "DT", "qualifierName": "drug therapy", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}, {"abbreviation": "MI", "qualifierName": "microbiology", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Oils, Volatile", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "PD", "qualifierName": "pharmacology", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "CH", "qualifierName": "chemistry", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "PD", "qualifierName": "pharmacology", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "CH", "qualifierName": "chemistry", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Machine Learning"}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Essential oil", "Antimicrobial", "Biofilm", "Machine Learning", "Staphylococcus Species"]}, "chemicalList": {"chemical": [{"name": "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "registryNumber": "0"}, {"name": "Oils, Volatile", "registryNumber": "0"}]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules24050890"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6429525"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6429525?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "18", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2019-06-13", "dateOfCreation": "2019-03-06", "firstIndexDate": "2019-03-05", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-10", "dateOfRevision": "2020-02-25", "electronicPublicationDate": "2019-03-03", "firstPublicationDate": "2019-03-03"}, "htmllinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6429525", "abstract": "Biofilm resistance to antimicrobials is a complex phenomenon, driven not only by genetic mutation induced resistance, but also by means of increased microbial cell density that supports horizontal gene transfer across cells.

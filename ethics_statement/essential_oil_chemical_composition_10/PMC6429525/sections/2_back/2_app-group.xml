  <p>The following are available online. Figure SM-1: PCA first 2 PCs graphical plots. Scores plot (panel A) indicate the presence of at least three clusters (circled in panel A). Loading plots (panel B) highlights that estragole, 
   <italic>o</italic>-cymene and pulegone could be the most important chemical constituents among all the tested EOs, Figure SM-2: 3-octanol, 
   <sc>d</sc>-limonene and pulegone partial dependence plots for the activation model on 6538P biofilm production, Figure SM-3: 
   <sc>d</sc>-limonene, γ-terpinene, 3-octanol and piperitenone partial dependence plots for the inhibition model on 25923 biofilm production, Figure SM-4: 3-octanol, phellandral, thymol and 
   <sc>d</sc>-limonene partial dependence plots for the inhibition model on RP62A biofilm, Figure SM-5: 3-octanol,

<p>To assess either modelsâ€™ fitness and robustness, their lack of chance correlation was checked by Y-scrambling procedure whose 100 runs of cross-validated scrambled set led to average, standard deviation, maximum and minimum values for Accuracy
 <sub>Y-S</sub>, MCC
 <sub>Y-S</sub>, Precision-Recall
 <sub>Y-S</sub> and ROC-AUC
 <sub>Y-S</sub> ROC-AUC coefficients always lower than non-cross-validated and cross-validated ones, therefore assessing validity of all final models.

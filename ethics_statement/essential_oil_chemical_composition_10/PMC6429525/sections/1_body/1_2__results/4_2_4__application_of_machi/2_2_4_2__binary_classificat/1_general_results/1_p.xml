<p>Analogously as in ML application to 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (PA) [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] direct application of linear classification methods using algorithms such as Logistic Regression (LR) and Linear Support Vector Machines (SVM) [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] did not lead to satisfying classifiers (data not shown). At the same time non-linear algorithms like random forest (RF) [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], non-linear support vector machine (SVM) [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and gradient boosting (GB) [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] also led to insufficiently robust models (data not shown). Therefore, a mixed approach was used and taking the idea from the principal component regression (PCR) as an evolution of multiple linear regression (MLR) a number of PCs were used in place of the original variables (EOs chemical component percentages) as input for the sklearn LR implementation (PCLR). As an initial test, the PCLR was run on the PA dataset leading to highly overlapping results with those obtained with the GB application (data not shown). Nevertheless, as biofilm production assay profiled EOs as either inhibitors of activators (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00890-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) accordingly, classification models were tentatively built for all four strains considering either biofilm production inhibition or activation for biofilm percentages observed at the two above introduced concentration levels of 48.8 μg/mL and 3.125 mg/mL. To this aim, initially the optimal biofilm production percentage cutoff for the binary classification was explored by systematically either decreasing it from a starting 80% to 60% or increasing from 120% to 140% for the inhibition or activation models, respectively, being the ranges arbitrarily chosen on the basis of 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00890-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> filled data. The models’ accuracy was monitored by the MCC value obtained by leave-one-out cross-validation. Following this protocol, for the inhibition models EOs samples characterized by higher values than the best performing cutoff of biofilm production percentage were classified as inactive, while those with lower values were considered active. On the contrary, regarding the biofilm production enhancer models, EOs samples characterized by higher percentages than the cutoff value were classified as active, while those with lower values were considered non-active. Regarding the 6538P inhibition training set, the very low active/inactive ratio at biofilm inhibition below 80% prevented any optimization. Therefore, the grid search analysis to the starting sixteen training sets (four strains by two series of models by two concentrations) afforded to seven optimized models for either concentrations (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00890-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Inspection of optimized models on both hyperparameters and cutoff values revealed for 25923/inhibition, RP62A/activation and O-47/activation sets composed of high unbalanced ratios of actives over non-actives and were hence not further analyzed. Comparing developed models for the two used EOs concentrations revealed 3.125 mg/mL level to lead to more reliable and robust models (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00890-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Based on the above preliminary data, subsequent results and analyses were only carried out on RP62A/inhibition, O-47/inhibition, 6538P/activation and 259237/activation models derived for biofilm modulation recorded at 3.125 mg/mL. This is in full agreement with the fact that EOs samples acted prevalently as reducer of biofilm production for RP62A and O-47 strains, while for 6538P and 25923 the biofilm production was mainly enhanced (

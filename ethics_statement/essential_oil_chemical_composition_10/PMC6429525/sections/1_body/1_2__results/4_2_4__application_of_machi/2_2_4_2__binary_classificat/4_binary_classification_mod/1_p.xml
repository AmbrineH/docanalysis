<p>The O-47/inhibition/3.125mg/mL optimized derived model was also obtained at cutoff of 62%, but with 19 PCs and a 0.51 actives:non-actives ratio (30:59) leading to 0.771, 0.590, 0.682 and 0.753 values for the Accuracy, MCC, Precision-Recall and ROC-AUC coefficients, respectively. Model robustness was assessed by Accuracy

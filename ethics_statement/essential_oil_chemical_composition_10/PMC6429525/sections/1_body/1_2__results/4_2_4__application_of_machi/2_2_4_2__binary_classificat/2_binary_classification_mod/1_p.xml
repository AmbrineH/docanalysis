<p>The 6538P/activation/3.125mg/mL optimized derived model was maximum at a cutoff of 133%, using 9 PCs, characterized by a 27:62 (0.44) proportion between actives and non-actives and high values of Accuracy (0.832), MCC (0.667), Precision-Recall (0.772) and ROC-AUC (0.824) coefficients which persisted to be quite good in cross-validation (Accuracy
 <sub>CV</sub> = 0.805, MCC
 <sub>CV</sub> = 0.613, Precision-Recall
 <sub>CV</sub> = 0.698 and ROC-AUC

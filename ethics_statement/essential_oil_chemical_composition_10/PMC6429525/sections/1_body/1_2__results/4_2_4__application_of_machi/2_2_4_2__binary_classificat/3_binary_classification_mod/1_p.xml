<p>The grid search on the EOsâ€™ chemical composition and their associated RP62A biofilm production inhibitory potencies at 3.125 mg/mL, identified 62% biofilm residual production as the best cutoff value with only 5 PCs and a actives over non-actives ratio of 31:58 (0.53). The final classification model was found characterized by Accuracy, MCC, Precision-Recall and ROC-AUC values of 0.721, 0.455, 0.657 and 0.742, respectively (

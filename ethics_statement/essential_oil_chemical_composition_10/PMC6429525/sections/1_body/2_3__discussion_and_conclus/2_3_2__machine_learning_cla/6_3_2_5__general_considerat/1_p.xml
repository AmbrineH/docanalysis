<p>According to the four classification models, two compounds, namely 3-octanol and 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene, can be considered as those that most influence biofilm production (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00890-t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>). In particular, 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene positively correlated either in inhibiting or in enhancement of biofilm production in three out of the four models while has a negative modulation on the ML model built on the biofilm enhancement of EOs’ on 25923 strain. These data indicate some controversial mechanism associated to 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene, it could be speculated that being this compound a highly apolar monoterpene its role could not be indirectly associated to biofilm modulation by altering the bacterial wall [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] allowing other compounds, likely oxygenated ones to enter the cell acting in altering some biochemical mechanism that could end in stimulation or inhibition of biofilm production. Nevertheless, on this topic the data available in the literature is controversial: Natcha and Caoili [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] reported that 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene is effective in inhibiting the growth of S. epidermidis RP62A when combined with the antibiotic rifampicin, likely due to 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene interference with biofilm formation. The effect of 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene in inhibiting bacterial biofilm formation was also proved against species of the genus Streptococcus [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] for which minimal biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC) of 400 μg/mL was determined. In a very recent study 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene was also reported as a biofilm inhibitor, although less efficient than an EO containing 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. On the contrary Kerekes et al. assayed a series of EOs and a list of chemical components against food-related micro-organisms and found 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene was almost deprived of any ability to inhibit biofilm production. In a study from Espina et al. 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene at 2000 μL/L was reported to reduce the production of biofilm mass in 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> USA300 by 90% after 8 h of incubation, but increase it by 30% after 40 h of incubation [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. EOs containing 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene and the isolated component were found to stimulate biofilm production on 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> and antibiotic-resistant 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> strains [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A similar profile and speculation on 3-octanol could also be deduced. 3-Octanol is a molecule resembling normal octanol, a compound commonly used to evaluate compound membrane permeability and lipophilicity through the determination of the logP parameter often used in ADME and QSAR studies. Unfortunately no data are available on the influence of 3-octanol on biofilm production, except for a single report in which the 8-carbon molecules 1-octen-3-ol, 3-octanol and 3-octanone specifically induced conidiation in Trichoderma species colonies placed in the dark [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Considering the possible cell wall permeation role of both 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene and 3-octanol for strains 6538P and 25923 pulegone, γ-terpinene and piperitenone, on the basis of the ML elaboration, could be the main components responsible for the modulation of EOs’ augmented biofilm production, while in the case RP62A and O-47 phellandral, thymol, 
 <italic>o</italic>-cymene and β-phellandrene are mainly responsible for positively (phellandral and thymol) or negatively (
 <italic>o</italic>-cymene and β-phellandrene) modulating EOs’ biofilm inhibition. Unfortunately no specific data data are available on these isolated components and the herein discussion although based on robust ML calculation are not experimentally based. It is worthy to note that the four bacterial strains tested here produced biofilms with different characteristics. First 6538P and 25923 belong to 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> species, while RP62A and O47 belong to 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> species. 25923 is classified as a strong biofilm producer, and 6538P is a medium/strong biofilm producer according to Cafiso and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Proteins are the major component in the biofilm matrix of 6538P, while in 25923 the polysaccharides have a predominant role. As regards the 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> strains, they are both strong biofilm makers and produce a biofilm mainly composed by polysaccharides. Moreover O-47 is a naturally occurring 
 <italic>agr</italic> mutant [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. As previously reported [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], 
 <italic>agr</italic>-negative genotype enhanced biofilm formation on polymer surfaces by an increased expression of the surface protein AtlE, a bifunctional adhesin/autolysin abundant in the cell wall of 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>. The amount of AtlE present in the cell envelop is one of the reported differences between RP62A and O-47 [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The overexpression of AtlE could induce significant changes in the hydrophobicity of the bacterial surface [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]; this effect could explain the different action of EOs on these two strains. Furthermore, the classification models were developed on the same EOs tested on 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilm production [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In that case, investigation of the most important components by means of feature importance and partial dependence plots indicated estragole and phellandral as the chemical components mostly related to biofilm inhibition of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, while 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene, pulegone and chrysanthenone seem to be related to its biofilm production. Although the use of feature importance and partial dependence plots shed some light on the possible role of some EOs’ components little is yet known on the role of the whole EOs mixture synergisms and anti-synergisms. Further studies on isolated EOs’ chemical components and on their simple mixture are currently under evaluation to develop more refined ML models able to disclose more details on the EOs’ mechanism of action.

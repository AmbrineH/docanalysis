<p>Similarly as for 6538P, also for the 25923 strain a ML model was built to correlate biofilm production enhancement with EOs’ chemical composition. Again, analysis of feature importance found as more important

 <sc>d</sc>-limonene, γ-terpinene, 3-octanol were suggested to negatively modulate the increase of biofilm, while piperitenone was found positively correlated (

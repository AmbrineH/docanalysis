<p>Regarding ML model derived on the biofilm inhibition capability of EOs the compounds more responsible for biofilm production modulation were found to be 3-octanol, 
 <italic>o</italic>-cymene, 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene and β-phellandrene (

 <sc>d</sc>-limonene were found positively associated with EOs’ inhibitory ability by partial dependence plots (

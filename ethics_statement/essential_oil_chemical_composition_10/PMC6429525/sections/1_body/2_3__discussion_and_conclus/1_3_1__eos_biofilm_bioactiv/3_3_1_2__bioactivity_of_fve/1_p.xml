<p>Among all tested EOs, those from FV comprise among the most active samples able to inhibit biofilm production (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00890-f002">Figure 2</xref>). In particular only mild effects (positive or negative modulation of biofilm production) were observed on 6538P strain (panel A of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00890-f002">Figure 2</xref>) with a few exception at both selected concentrations, including FA24, FS2, FO3 and FO6 that increased biofilm production by about 40–60%, and FOM1 that inhibited biofilm production by about 50% at 3.125 mg/mL. On the contrary, some FVEOs proved to be potent antibiofilm agents on 
 <italic>S. epidermids</italic> RP62A (panel B of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00890-f002">Figure 2</xref>). In particular 5 out 33 FVEOs (FO1, FO3, FO6, FO24 and FOM3) inhibited biofilm formation with a rate of about 80% (panel B of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00890-f002">Figure 2</xref>) and were selected for further analyses using scalar concentration of each EO starting from 0.0488 mg/mL. Similarly as for the selected potent RSEOs, no direct dose dependent effect was determined (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00890-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Interestingly, on O-47 biofilm modulation most FVEOs showed a bioactivity profile almost overlapping that for RP62A with FO1, FO3, FO6, FO24 and FOM3 samples able to reduce biofilm formation of about 50–70% (panel C of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00890-f002">Figure 2</xref>). While on both 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> strains RP62A and O-47, FVEOs displayed some peculiar samples with interesting biofilm inhibitory potencies in case of 25923 strain FVEOs displayed an overall bioactivity profile similar to that for RSEOs against O-47 (compare panel C of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00890-f001">Figure 1</xref> with panel D of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00890-f002">Figure 2</xref>).

<p>From the results reported above it could be observed that each EO had a specific effect on biofilm formation, likely depending on its characteristics and unique chemical composition. In particular for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains 6538P and 25923 the EOs mainly exhibited an enhancement of biofilm production. Stimulation of bacterial biofilm production by EOs is not surprising as it was previously observed, even by isolated chemical components [

 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> strains RP62A and O-47 an overall inhibition effect on biofilm production was observed by in vitro EOs treatment. Nevertheless, cinnamon EO was reported to stimulate biofilm production on some 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> strains [

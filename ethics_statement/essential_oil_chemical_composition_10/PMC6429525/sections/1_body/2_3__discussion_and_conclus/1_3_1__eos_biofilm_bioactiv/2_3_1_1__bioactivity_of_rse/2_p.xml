<p>On O-47 biofilm modulation (panel C of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00890-f001">Figure 1</xref>) most RSEOs had a slight inhibition effect up to 40% (60% residual of biofilm production) at 0.0488 mg/mL. On the contrary, at the higher concentration RSEOs enhanced biofilm production by up to 130% for most samples. Only RM6 showed a remarkable biofilm production up to 160% at 3.125 mg/mL. For strain 25923 a profile similar to that of RP62A was observed (panel D of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00890-f001">Figure 1</xref>), therefore no further investigation were pursued on the R6, R24, RM4 and RM6 samples despite the high inhibitory biofilm potency with residual biofilm production ranging 20â€“30%.

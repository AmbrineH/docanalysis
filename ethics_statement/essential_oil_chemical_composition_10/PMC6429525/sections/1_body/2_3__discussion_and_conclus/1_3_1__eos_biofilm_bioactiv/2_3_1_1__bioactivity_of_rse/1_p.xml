<p>The majority of tested RSEO samples did not show inhibitory effects on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> 6538P biofilm formation (a partial inhibitory effect was observed only for R6 essential oil at 3.125 mg/mL, panel A of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00890-f001">Figure 1</xref>). On the contrary, some RSEO samples (R6, R12, R24, RM4 and RM6) were shown to enhance biofilm formation by up to 140% at 0.0488 mg/mL Differently, several RSEO samples showed a good inhibitory effect on 
 <italic>S. epidermids</italic> RP62A biofilm production. In particular 4 out of 13 EOs (R6, R24, RM4 and RM6) were able to potently inhibit biofilm formation with a rate of about 80% at either used concentrations (panel B of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00890-f001">Figure 1</xref>), thus these EOs were selected for further analyses using scalar concentration of each EO starting from 0.0488 mg/mL. An attempt to determine a direct dose dependent effect was not effective (

<p>EOs from CG are the most modulating biofilm producers either in positive (activators) or in negative (inhibitors). In particular in the case of strain 6538P all samples at either concentrations can be classified as neutral or biofilm promoters (panel A of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00890-f003">Figure 3</xref>) with a strong inclination to increase biofilm production by up to 500% (CAM1). Other strong biofilm inducers (percentages over 300%) are CAM3, CAM5, CS1, CS3, CS6 and CS24 samples. Many other CGEOs, although to a lesser extent, induced a doubling or even tripling of biofilm production. On the contrary most of CGEOs displayed an inhibition by over 50% of biofilm production by RP62A (panel B of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00890-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Many CGEO samples were further investigated and for 6 of them (CO2, CO6, COM5, CS2, CS6 and CSM5) a definite dose dependent relation was observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00890-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Regarding biofilm modulation for O-47 CGEOs in this case presented, at either tested concentrations, a mixed scenario in which some samples induced an enhanced biofilm production up to 250-350% (CAM5, CS1, CS3, CS6, CSM1 and CSM3) and 15 different samples showed high inhibition potencies (percentages of residual biofilm lower than 40â€“50%).

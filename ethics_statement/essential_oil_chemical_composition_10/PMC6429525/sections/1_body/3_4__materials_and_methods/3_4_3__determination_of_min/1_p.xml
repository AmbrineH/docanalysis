<p>The MIC was determined as the lowest concentration at which the observable bacterial growth was inhibited. MICs were determined according to the guidelines of Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI [

 <sup>6</sup> cfu/mL) of bacterial culture in exponential phase was used. Ten concentrations were used within the 25â€“0.045 mg/mL range. Experiments were performed in quadruplicate.

<p>Bacterial strains used in this work (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00890-t009" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>) were grown in Brain Heart Infusion broth (BHI, Oxoid, UK). Biofilm formation was assessed in static conditions. Planktonic cultures were grown in flasks under vigorous agitation (180 rpm) at 37 Â°C. In particular, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 6538P (6538P) and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 25923 (25923) are reference strains for antimicrobial testing; 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> RP62A (RP62A) is a reference strain isolated from infected catheter, while 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> O-47 (O-47) is a clinical isolate strong biofilm producer strain characterized by a genomic mutation in 
 <italic>agr locus</italic> [

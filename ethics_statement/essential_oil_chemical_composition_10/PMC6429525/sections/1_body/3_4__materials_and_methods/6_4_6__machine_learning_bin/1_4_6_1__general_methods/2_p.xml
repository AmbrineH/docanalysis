<p>The binary classification models were numerically and graphically evaluated by accuracy (ACC), Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and precision-recall (PR) curves. Finally, the importance of EOs chemical components was evaluated individually through the “feature importance” and “partial dependence” plots [

 <xref rid="B59-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Feature importance is a generic term for the degree to which a predictive model relies on a particular feature. Skater feature importance implementation is based on an information theoretic criteria, measuring the entropy in the change of predictions, given a perturbation of a given feature [

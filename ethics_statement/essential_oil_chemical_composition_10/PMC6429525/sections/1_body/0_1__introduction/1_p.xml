<p>A biofilm is a microbially derived sessile community characterized by cells irreversibly attached to a substrate or interface or to each other, embedded in a self-produced matrix of extracellular polymeric substances, which exhibits an altered phenotype with regard to growth, gene expression and protein production [

 <xref rid="B2-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] is a complex phenomenon, driven not only by genetic mutation induced resistance, but also by means of increased microbial cell density that supports resistance by means of horizontal gene transfer across cells [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Indeed, other mechanisms are involved, such as: (i) low penetration of antimicrobial agents due to the barrier function exerted by the biofilm matrix, (ii) presence of cells exhibiting a high multidrug tolerance, (iii) reduced susceptibility to antibiotics as a consequence of stress adaptive responses or changes in the chemical biofilm microenvironment [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The strategies adopted to treat these challenging infections are rapidly changing due to the increasing understanding of biofilm structure and functions. Nonetheless, the prevention of biofilm formation and the treatment of existing biofilms is currently a difficult challenge; therefore, the discovery of new multi-targeted or combinatorial therapies is increasingly urgent [

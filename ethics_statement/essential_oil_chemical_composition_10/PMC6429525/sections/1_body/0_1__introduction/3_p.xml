<p>Recently machine learning (ML) has been proved as a tool able to deeply investigate the modulatory role of EOs’ chemical components on 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> biofilm production [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In particular, 89 EOs extracted in different periods and times of extractions from three different plants were analyzed: 13 EOs (RSEOs) from 
 <italic>Ridolfia segetum Moris</italic> (RS); 32 EOs (FVEOs) from 
 <italic>Foeniculum vulgare</italic> Miller (FV) and 44 EOs (CGEOs) from 
 <italic>Calamintha nepeta</italic> (L.) Savi subsp. 
 <italic>glandulosa</italic> (Req.) Ball, (CG) [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In line with that study and with the objective of investigating EOs’ ability to also reduce bacterial biofilm production in other bacteria, herein is reported an extensive study of the 89 EOs samples as potential antibacterial and anti-biofilm agents against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 6538P, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 25923, 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> RP62A and 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> O-47. To this purpose, like previously reported [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], ML algorithms were applied to the EOs’ chemical compositions and the determined associated anti-biofilm potencies, with the purpose of shedding light on those components likely mainly responsible for either positive or negative modulation of biofilm production.

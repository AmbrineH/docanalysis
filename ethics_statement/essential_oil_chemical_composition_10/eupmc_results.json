the disease. Furthermore, xanthine oxidase (XO) is a key enzyme that catalyzes hypoxanthine and xanthine to uric acid which at high levels can lead to hyperuricemia which is an important cause of gout. Pancreatic lipase (PL) secreted into the duodenum plays a key role in the digestion and absorption of fats. For its importance in lipid digestion, PL represents an attractive target for obesity prevention.<h4>Methods</h4>The flowers essential oil of Rhaponticum acaule (L) DC (R. acaule) was characterized using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The antioxidant activities of R. acaule essential oil (RaEO) were also determined using 2,2'-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS), reducing power, phosphomolybdenum, and DNA nicking assays. The inhibitory power of RaEO against \u03b1-glucosidase, xanthine oxidase and pancreatic lipase was evaluated. Enzyme kinetic studies using Michaelis-Menten and the derived Lineweaver-Burk (LB) plots were performed to understand the possible mechanism of inhibition exercised by the components of this essential oil.<h4>Results</h4>The result revealed the presence of 26 compounds (97.4%).

Citrus plants constitute one of the main valuable sources of essential oil used in foods and medicinal purposes.<h4>Methods</h4>In this study, we assessed chemical composition, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of C. limon essential oil (ClEO) with its preservative effect against Listeria monocytogenes inoculated in minced beef meat. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to identify the major components of the obtained ClEO. The antioxidant activities of this ClEO were determined according to the \u03b2-carotene bleaching assay, as well as by 2.2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity. For antimicrobial activity, agar well diffusion method was used and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) as well as the minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) were determined. The in situ effect of the ClEO was evaluated through physicochemical parameters (pH and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), as well as against L. monocytogenes in minced beef meat model.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty one components were identified in the ClEO and the two dominant compounds were limonene (39.74%) and \u03b2-Pinene (25.44%). This ClEO displayed an excellent DPPH scavenging ability with an extract concentration providing 50% inhibition (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 15.056\u00a0\u03bcg/ml and a strong \u03b2-carotene bleaching inhibition after 120\u00a0min of incubation with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 40.147\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. The MICs varied from 0.039 to 1.25\u00a0mg/ml for Gram positive bacteria and from 0.25 to 2.5\u00a0mg/ml for Gram-negative bacteria. The meat preserving potential of ClEO was investigated against L. monocytogenes. ClEO successfully inhibited development of L. monocytogenes in minced beef meat. The application of ClEO at a 0.06 and 0.312\u00a0mg/g, may open new promising opportunities for the prevention of contamination from and growth of pathogenic bacteria, particularly L. monocytogenes, during minced beef meat storage at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Additionally, during storage period, physicochemical values (pH and TBARS) were higher in control meat than treated meat with ClEO suggesting an efficient antioxidant activity of ClEO.<h4>Conclusion</h4>It was suggested that the ClEO may be a new potential source as natural antimicrobial and antioxidant agents applied in food systems and pharmaceutical industry.",

"<h4>Background</h4>Lemon (Citrus limon) is a flowing plant belonging to the Rutaceae family. Citrus plants constitute one of the main valuable sources of essential oil used in foods and medicinal purposes.<h4>Methods</h4>In this study, we assessed chemical composition, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of C. limon essential oil (ClEO) with its preservative effect against Listeria monocytogenes inoculated in minced beef meat. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to identify the major components of the obtained ClEO. The antioxidant activities of this ClEO were determined according to the \u03b2-carotene bleaching assay, as well as by 2.2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity. For antimicrobial activity, agar well diffusion method was used and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) as well as the minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) were determined. The in situ effect of the ClEO was evaluated through physicochemical parameters (pH and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), as well as against L. monocytogenes in minced beef meat model.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty one components were identified in the ClEO and the two dominant compounds were limonene (39.74%) and \u03b2-Pinene (25.44%). This ClEO displayed an excellent DPPH scavenging ability with an extract concentration providing 50% inhibition (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 15.056\u00a0\u03bcg/ml and a strong \u03b2-carotene bleaching inhibition after 120\u00a0min of incubation with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 40.147\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. The MICs varied from 0.039 to 1.25\u00a0mg/ml for Gram positive bacteria and from 0.25 to 2.5\u00a0mg/ml for Gram-negative bacteria. The meat preserving potential of ClEO was investigated against L. monocytogenes. ClEO successfully inhibited development of L. monocytogenes in minced beef meat. The application of ClEO at a 0.06 and 0.312\u00a0mg/g, may open new promising opportunities for the prevention of contamination from and growth of pathogenic bacteria, particularly L. monocytogenes, during minced beef meat storage at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Additionally, during storage period, physicochemical values (pH and TBARS) were higher in control meat than treated meat with ClEO suggesting an efficient antioxidant activity of ClEO.<h4>Conclusion</h4>It was suggested that the ClEO may be a new potential source as natural antimicrobial and antioxidant agents applied in food systems and pharmaceutical industry.", "Keywords": ["Essential oil", "Antimicrobial activity", "Antioxidant activity", "Listeria monocytogenes", "Citrus limon", "Minced Beef Meat"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5543433?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Lipids in health and disease", "authorinfo": ["Ben Hsouna A", "Ben Halima N", "Smaoui S", "Hamdi N"], "title": "Citrus lemon essential oil: chemical composition, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities with its preservative effect against Listeria monocytogenes inoculated in minced beef meat."}, "PMC6332415": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "26262604", "source": "MED", "pmid": "26262604", "pmcid": "PMC6332415", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC6332415"}, "doi": "10.3390/molecules200814402", "title": "Mentha spicata Essential Oil: Chemical Composition, Antioxidant and Antibacterial Activities against Planktonic and Biofilm Cultures of Vibrio spp. Strains.", "authorString": "Snoussi M, Noumi E, Trabelsi N, Flamini G, Papetti A, De Feo V.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Snoussi M", "firstName": "Mejdi", "lastName": "Snoussi", "initials": "M", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-2309-2601"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Laboratoire de Traitement des Eaux Us\u00e9es, Centre de Recherches et des Technologies des Eaux (CERTE), Technopole de Borj-C\u00e9dria, BP 273, 8020 Soliman, Tunisia. snmejdi@yahoo.fr."}}}, {"fullName": "Noumi E", "firstName": "Emira", "lastName": "Noumi", "initials": "E", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Laboratory of Transmissible Diseases and Biological Active Substances, University of Monastir, Avenue Avicenne, 5000 Monastir, Tunisia. emira_noumi@yahoo.fr."}}}, {"fullName": "Trabelsi N", "firstName": "Najla", "lastName": "Trabelsi", "initials": "N", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-5724-5194"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Laboratoire de Biotechnologie de l'Olivier, Centre de Biotechnologie de Borj C\u00e9dria, BP 901, 2050 Hammam Lif, Tunisia. trabnajla@yahoo.fr."}}}, {"fullName": "Flamini G", "firstName": "Guido", "lastName": "Flamini", "initials": "G", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-2418-9349"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Pisa, Via Bonanno, 6, 56126 Pisa, Italy. guido.flamini@farm.unipi.it."}}}, {"fullName": "Papetti A", "firstName": "Adele", "lastName": "Papetti", "initials": "A", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Drug Sciences, University of Pavia, Viale Taramelli, 12, 27100 Pavia, Italy. adele.papetti@unipv.it."}}}, {"fullName": "De Feo V", "firstName": "Vincenzo", "lastName": "De Feo", "initials": "V", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Salerno, Via Giovanni Paolo II, 132, Fisciano 84084, Salerno, Italy. defeo@unisa.it."}}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": [{"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-2309-2601"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-5724-5194"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-2418-9349"}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": "altmetrics"}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "8", "volume": "20", "journalIssueId": "2460472", "dateOfPublication": "2015 Aug", "monthOfPublication": "8", "yearOfPublication": "2015", "printPublicationDate": "2015-08-01", "journal": {"title": "Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)", "ISOAbbreviation": "Molecules", "medlineAbbreviation": "Molecules", "NLMid": "100964009", "ISSN": "1420-3049", "ESSN": "1420-3049"}}, "pubYear": "2015", "pageInfo": "14402-14424", "abstractText": "Chemical composition, antioxidant and anti-Vibrio spp. activities of the essential oil isolated from the aerial parts of Mentha spicata L.

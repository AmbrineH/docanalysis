<p>The ability of the spearmint essential oil to reduce Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> was assayed by the method of Hajlaoui 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Briefly, 1 mL of spearmint essential oil was mixed with 2.5 mL of phosphate buffer (0.2 M, pH 6.6) and 2.5 mL of K
 <sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)
 <sub>6</sub> solution (1 g/100 mL). The mixture was incubated at 50 °C for 25 min, then 2.5 mL of a trichloroacetic acid solution (10 g/100 mL) was added and the mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 650× 
 <italic>g</italic>. Finally, 2.5 mL of the upper layer was mixed with 2.5 mL of distilled water and 0.5 mL of FeCl
 <sub>3</sub> aqueous solution (0.1 g/100 mL). The absorbance of the mixture was measured at 700 nm. A higher absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated a higher reducing power. A standard curve was generated using ascorbic acid (10–100 µg/mL), plotting the mean absorbance values against ascorbic acid concentrations, and a linear regression analysis was carried out. The EC
 <sub>50</sub> value (µg/mL) is the effective concentration at which the absorbance was 0.5 for the reducing power. Ascorbic acid was used as a positive control.

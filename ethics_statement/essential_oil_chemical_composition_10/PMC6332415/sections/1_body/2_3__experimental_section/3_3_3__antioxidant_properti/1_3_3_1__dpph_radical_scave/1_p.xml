<p>The DPPH radical scavenging activity was evaluated according to the method described by Hajlaoui 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] with some modifications. Briefly, 0.25 mL of a 0.2 mM DPPH• methanolic solution was mixed with 1 mL of essential oil at different concentrations (0.01, 0.02, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/mL) or with 1 mL of control sample. The mixture was left for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. The absorbance was measured at 515 nm and the scavenging activity (SA%) against DPPH radicals was calculated using the following equation: 
 <disp-formula> SA% = [(A
  <sub>c</sub> − A
  <sub>s</sub>)/A
  <sub>c</sub>] × 100 
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where A
 <sub>c</sub> is the absorbance of the control at 30 min and A
 <sub>s</sub> is the absorbance of the sample at 30 min; a BHT solution at different concentrations (1–50 µg/mL) was also tested. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values represented the essential oil and BHT concentrations (µg/mL) scavenging 50% of DPPH radicals. All samples were analyzed in triplicate.

<p>Five antibiotics were used in this study as positive controls for 
 <italic>Vibrio</italic> spp. strains. The antibiotic susceptibility was determined using the Kirby-Bauer method and Mueller-Hinton agar plates supplemented with 1% NaCl, as described by Ottaviani 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B87-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. The dishes were incubated at 37 °C for 18–24 h for microbial strains. The diameter of the zones of inhibition was measured with 1 mm flat rule. Each experiment was carried out in triplicate and the mean diameter of the inhibition zone was recorded.

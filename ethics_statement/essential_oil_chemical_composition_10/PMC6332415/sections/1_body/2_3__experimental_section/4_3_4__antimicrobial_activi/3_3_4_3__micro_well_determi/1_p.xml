<p>The minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) and the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) values were determined for all 
 <italic>Vibrio</italic> spp. strains used in this study as described by Gulluce 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B88-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] and Snoussi 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The inocula of the bacterial strains were prepared from overnight cultures and suspensions were adjusted to 0.1 standard turbidity (OD
 <sub>600nm</sub>). The essential oil dissolved in 10% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was diluted to the highest concentration (48 mg/mL) to be tested and then serial twofold dilutions were made in the concentration range 0.023–24 mg/mL in the 96-well plates. In fact, the 96-well plates were prepared by dispensing into each well 95 µL of Mueller-Hinton 1% NaCl broth. Then, 100 µL of the highest concentration (48 mg/mL) were added to the first well and consecutively two-fold dilutions were prepared in the next 10 wells. Finally, 5µL of the inoculum of each microorganism were added to the wells. The last well, containing 195 µL of Mueller-Hinton 1% NaCl broth without essential oil and 5 µL of the bacterial inoculum of each strain, was used as the negative control. The final volume in each well was 200 µL. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 18–24 h.

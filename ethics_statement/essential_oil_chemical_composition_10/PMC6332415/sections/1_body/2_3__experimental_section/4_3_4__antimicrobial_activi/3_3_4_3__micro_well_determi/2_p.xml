<p>The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of the sample that did not permit any visible growth of the tested microorganism after incubation at 37 °C as compared to the control well (grown without essential oil), whereas the MBC value was determined by subculture of 10 µL from the wells medium with no visible growth onto Mueller–Hinton agar plates. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, the growth of the microorganism was observed. When no growth was observed, the sample denoted a bactericidal action.</p>

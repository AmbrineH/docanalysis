<p>The ability of 
 <italic>Vibrio</italic> spp. strains to form a biofilm on polystyrene surface was quantified using the XTT [2,3-bis(2-methyloxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2
 <italic>H</italic>-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide] reduction assay, according to methods described previously by Chaieb 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B89-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. This technique measures the metabolic activity of cells in biofilm by measuring the reduction of a tetrazolium salt by metabolically active cells to a colored water-soluble formazan derivative easily quantified calorimetrically. Eight 
 <italic>Vibrio</italic> spp. strains (
 <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> ATCC 17749, 
 <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> ATCC 33787, 
 <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> ATCC 17802, 
 <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> (Malaga), 
 <italic>V. vulnificus</italic> ATCC 27962, 
 <italic>V. vulnificus</italic> ATCC 27562, 
 <italic>V. cholerae</italic> non O1 (IPT), and 
 <italic>V. cholerae</italic> ATCC 9459) were grown overnight in Brain Infusion Broth (BHI-0.25 glucose at 37 °C). The culture was diluted 1:20 in fresh BHI-1% NaCl plus (0.25%) glucose at 37 °C. Two hundred μL of this suspension were used to inoculate sterile 96-well-polystyrene microtiter plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). XTT (Sigma-Aldrich, Buchs, Switzerland) solution (1 mg/mL) was prepared in PBS, filter sterilized, and stored at −80 °C. Menadione (Sigma-Aldrich) solution (1 mM) was prepared in acetone and sterilized immediately before each assay. Following incubation, the biofilms were first washed five times with PBS, and then 100 μL PBS and 12 μL XTT–menadione solution (12.5:1 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) were added to each of the prewashed wells and the control wells. The plate was then incubated for 3 h in the dark at 37 °C. Following incubation, 100 μL of the solution was transferred to fresh wells, and the color change in the solution was measured with a Multiskan reader at 490 nm (BioRad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France). The absorbance values for the controls were then subtracted from the values of the tested wells to eliminate spurious results due to background interference. Each assay was repeated three times.

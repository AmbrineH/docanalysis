 <xref rid="B1-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] by Professor Abderrezak Smaoui from the Center of Biotechnology (Technopark of Borj Cédria, Tunisie). A voucher specimen (SM-1) was deposited in the laboratory of Wastewaters Treatment of the Biotechnology Centre. The aerial parts were dried at room temperature. One hundred grams of material sample were subjected to hydrodistillation for 3 h with 500 mL of distilled water using a Clevenger-type apparatus according to the

 <xref rid="B78-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. This step was repeated many times to obtain a considerable volume of essential oil (10 mL), then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and stored in sealed glass vials in a refrigerator at 4 °C prior to analysis. The density of the essential oil obtained was 0.96 (10 µL of essential oil weighted 9.6 mg).

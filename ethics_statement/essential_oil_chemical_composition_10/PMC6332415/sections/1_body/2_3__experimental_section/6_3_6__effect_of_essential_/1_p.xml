 <italic>Mentha spicata</italic> essential oil was tested for its potential to inhibit and/or eradicate biofilm formation of four type strains including: 
 <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> ATCC 33787, 
 <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> ATCC 17802, 
 <italic>V. vulnificus</italic> ATCC 27962, and 
 <italic>V. cholerae</italic> ATCC 9459 as previously described by Nostro 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B90-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] with some modifications. The essential oils was added to the growth medium (BHI-1% NaCl plus 0.25% glucose) at the time of inoculation and the cells were allowed to form biofilms. Prevention of biofilm formation was examined by microdilution, similar to the MIC assay for planktonic cells. A two-fold serial dilution was prepared in 96-well polystyrene tissue culture plates containing BHI-1% NaCl plus 0.25% glucose with final concentrations of essential oil corresponding to 2 MIC, 4 MIC, 8 MIC, MBC, and &gt;MBC (50 mg/mL). The medium without essential oil was used as a control. Each assay was repeated three times. The XTT assay was also used to quantify the biofilm formed. In order to access the ability of the essential oil to prevent biofilm formation, the percentage of biofilm inhibition was calculated using the equation: 
 <disp-formula> [(OD(growth control) − OD(sample))/OD(growth control)] × 100 
  <label>(4)</label>
 </disp-formula>

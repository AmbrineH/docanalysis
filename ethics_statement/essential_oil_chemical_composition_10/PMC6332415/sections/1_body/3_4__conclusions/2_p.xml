<p>Furthermore, the high antioxidant and anti-free radical activities registered could be important to preserve marine products known to contain a number of components prone to degradation. In particular, polyunsaturated fatty acids that quickly undergo peroxidation, generating as a primary product the peroxyl radicals, could be efficiently scavenged by the

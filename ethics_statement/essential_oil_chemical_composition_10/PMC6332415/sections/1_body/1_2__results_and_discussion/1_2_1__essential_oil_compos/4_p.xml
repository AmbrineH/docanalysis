<p>Recently, Zhao 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] studied the variation in the chemical composition of eight accessions of 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic> essential oil originating from seven provinces in China. The essential oil yield varied from 0.5% to 0.8% of the dry weight and these accessions were grouped into the single chemotype carvone (46.7%–65.41%). The percentage of oxygenated monoterpenes ranges between 87.1% and 94%. In the same year, Padalia 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] studied the chemical composition of 16 cultivars of 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> from the western Himalayan region (China) and reported that carvone (51.3%–65.1%), limonene (15.1%–25.2%), β-pinene (1.3%–3.2%), and 1,8-cineole (≤0.1%–3.6%) are the major components in five cultivars of 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic>.

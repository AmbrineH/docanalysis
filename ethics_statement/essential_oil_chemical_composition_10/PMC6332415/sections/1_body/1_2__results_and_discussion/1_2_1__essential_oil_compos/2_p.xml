<p>The differences in oil content and composition may be attributed to factors related to ecotype, phenophases, temperature, relative humidity, photoperiod, irradiance, genotype, and agronomic conditions (harvesting time, plantage, crop density). In the north Indian plains carvone content varies between 45.9% and 77.1% [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The percentage of carvone also varies in the essential oil of spearmint growing in different countries, e.g., Egypt (46.4%–68.55%) [

 <xref rid="B35-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. A linalool-rich chemotype (82.8%) was also reported from Turkey [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In another report on 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic> essential oil from Iran, α-terpinene (19.7%), piperitone oxide (19.3%), isomenthone (10.3%), and β-caryophyllene (7.6%) were reported as major components [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], while the Serbian 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic> essential oil is characterized by menthone (21.9%), carvone (49.5%), limonene (5.7%), 1,8-cineole (3%), and β-mycrene (2.3%) as its main components [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Chauhan 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] reported that the fresh plants from the northwest Himalayan region (China) have 0.57% essential oil on a fresh weight basis, with a total of 20 compounds constituting 96.24% of the total essential oil. The main components were carvone (76.65%), limonene (9.57%), cis-dihydrocarvone (2.04%), and 1,8-cineole (1.93%). In Egypt, Omar 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] reported that menthone (32.43%), 1,8-cineole (18.79%),

 <italic>iso</italic> pulegone (16.65%), pulegone (10.01%), β-pinene (7.12%), α-cadinol (5.30%), and α-pinene (5.03%) were the main components of the 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic> essential oil harvested from the Zagazig Region.

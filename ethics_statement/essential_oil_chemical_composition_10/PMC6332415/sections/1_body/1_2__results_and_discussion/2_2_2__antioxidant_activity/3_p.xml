 <italic>M. spicata.</italic> Mata 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] stated that an ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic> showed lower antioxidant activity than that of BHT. Arumugam 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] indicates that the ethyl acetate fraction of an ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic> showed higher antioxidant activity against ABTSâ€¢+ than the hexane and chloroform fractions. This activity is due to the high content of phenolic compounds, which could be most effective in protecting the body against various oxidative stressors.

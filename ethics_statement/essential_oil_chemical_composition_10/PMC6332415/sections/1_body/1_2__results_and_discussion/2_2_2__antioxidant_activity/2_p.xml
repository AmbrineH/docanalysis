<p>The antioxidant ability of the spearmint oil was measured by the bleaching of a purple methanol solution of DPPH. This spectrophotometric assay uses the stable radical 2,2′-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) as a reagent. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value for spearmint essential oil was 3 µg/mL in comparison to 11.5 µg/mL for the standard compound, BHT. Dhifi 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] reported that the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of the 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic> essential oil harvested from south of Tunisia (chemotype menthone/pulegone) was about 10 µg/mL. Some compounds such as as phenylpropanoids, monoterpenes, and oxygenated sesquiterpenes are reported to have oxidation inhibition capacity [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This interesting biological activity can be explained by the presence in our oil of the monoterpenes limonene, terpinolene, γ-terpinene, 1,8-cineole, and carvone.

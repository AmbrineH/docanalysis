<p>The discovery of anti-infective agents, active not only against planktonic micro-organisms but also against microbial biofilms, represents an important goal. In fact, prevention of the biofilm formation effect of plant derivatives has been reported in the case of 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, and oral pathogens; however, few studies reported the same effect on pathogenic 
 <italic>Vibrio</italic> strains [
 <xref rid="B70-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In this study we tested the ability of different concentrations of 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic> essential oil to inhibit or eradicate biofilm on a polystyrene surface formed by four pathogenic 
 <italic>Vibrio</italic> spp. species, 
 <italic>V. vulnificus</italic>; 
 <italic>V. cholerae</italic>; 
 <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>, and 
 <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic>. Our results showed that spearmint essential oil inhibited the tested 
 <italic>Vibrio</italic> spp. Strainsâ€™ biofilm production by 11.5% and 11.6% for 
 <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> ATCC 33787, and by 28% and 40% for 
 <italic>V. vulnificus</italic> ATCC 27562 at 0.046 and 0.092 mg/mL, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-20-14402-f001">Figure 1</xref>). As regards the 
 <italic>Vibrio</italic> preformed biofilm disruption (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-20-14402-f002">Figure 2</xref>), the spearmint essential oil eradicated more than 50% of preformed 
 <italic>V. cholerae</italic> ATCC 9459 and 
 <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> ATCC 3378 biofilms at 0.092 mg/mL. The fact that any activity was reliable only at concentrations higher than the MIC values leads us to believe that such activities are due to the bacteriostatic activity of the essential oil rather than to the presence of compounds affecting the biofilm formation.

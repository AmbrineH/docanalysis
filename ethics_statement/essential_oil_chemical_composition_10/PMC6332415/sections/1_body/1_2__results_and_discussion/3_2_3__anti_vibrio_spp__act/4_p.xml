 <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> activity of 18 spices and herbs from Japan and reported that the pathogenic serotype strains O3:K6 and O4:K8 was sensitive to all spices and herbs tested. Consequently, the studied extracts can be used for protecting seafood from the risk of contamination by 
 <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> strains. Indeed, Shelef

 <italic>Achillea kellalensis</italic> Boiss. &amp; Hausskn., and 
 <italic>Cuminun cyminum</italic> L., utilized as traditional medicines by the indigenous people of Chaharmahal va Bakhtiari in Iran, showed antibacterial activities against 
 <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> and 
 <italic>V. harveyi</italic> [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The highest level of antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> was demonstrated by the essential oil of 
 <italic>T. daenensis</italic> (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC = 7 µg/mL), and the highest level of antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>V. harveyi</italic> was demonstrated by the essential oil of 
 <italic>S. bachtiarica</italic> (MIC = 15 µg/mL).

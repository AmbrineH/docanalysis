 <italic>R-</italic>) and (
 <italic>S-</italic>) carvones exert an antimicrobial effect by interacting with the microbial membrane due to their inherent lipophilicity, while, the combination of 
 <italic>R</italic>- and 
 <italic>S</italic>-carvone suggested that carvones have a high affinity for the bacterial cell membrane and may influence structural or functional properties of the membrane [
 <xref rid="B65-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. In fact, using the Transmission Electron Microscope, Mun and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] revealed cytoplasmic disruption and separation of the cytoplasmic contents of methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains following exposure to 
 <italic>R</italic>-carvone. Additionally, (
 <italic>4R</italic>)-(−)-carvone was also active against 
 <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic>, 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> [

 <italic>4S</italic>)-(+)-carvone was effective against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7, 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium Photobacterium leiognathi</italic>, and 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> [

 <xref rid="B68-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. In a previous work carried out by Aggarwal 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B69-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], the results showed that the main components found in 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic> oil were (
 <italic>4S</italic>)-(−)-limonene, (
 <italic>4R</italic>)-(−)-carvone), (
 <italic>R</italic>)-(+)-limonene, and (
 <italic>4S</italic>)-(+)-carvone) for 
 <italic>A. sowa</italic> Roxb essential oil. They also found that both optical isomers of carvone were active against a wide spectrum of human pathogenic fungi and bacteria. Additionally, the antimicrobial properties of these monoterpenes were similar to those in spearmint and Indian dill essential oils.

<p>The antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic> L. essential oil tested against 30 
 <italic>Vibrio</italic> spp. microorganisms was examined both qualitatively (inhibition zone diameter) and quantitatively (MIC and MBC values). Moreover, its potency to inhibit and eradicate the biofilm formed on polystyrene surface (XTT assay) was tested in the present study (
 <xref rid="molecules-20-14402-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The results showed that the studied essential oil had substantial anti-
 <italic>Vibrio</italic> spp. activity with zones of growth inhibition (mm) scored in Mueller-Hinton agar-1% NaCl ranging from 7 ± 0 mm for 
 <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> ATCC 17749 to 21.33 ± 0.58 mm for 
 <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> (Malaga, Spain). Interestingly, 
 <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> and 
 <italic>V. vulnificus</italic> strains isolated from 
 <italic>Dicentrarchus labrax</italic>, 
 <italic>Sparus aurata</italic>, and 
 <italic>Mytilus edulis</italic> were more sensitive to the spearmint essential oil than the two 
 <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> strains associated with 
 <italic>M. edulis</italic> from the Bizerte Lagoon (10.00 and 11.67 mm, respectively). The essential oil bacteriostatic activity was confirmed by the low MIC values, ranging from 0.023 to 0.047 mg/mL, while higher concentrations were needed for a bactericidal action (MBC values ranging from 0.75 to 12 mg/mL).

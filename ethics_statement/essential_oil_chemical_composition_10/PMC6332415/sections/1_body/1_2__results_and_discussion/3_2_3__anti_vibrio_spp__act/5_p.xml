 <italic>M. spicata</italic> essential oil from Serbia (carvone/menthone chemotype) tested in the disc-diffusion method showed better activity against Gram+ bacteria than Gram− with a bacteriostatic activity in concentration of 1 µg/mL with diameter of inhibition zone ranging from 10 mm (
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>) to 25 mm (
 <italic>Micrococcus flavus</italic>) and MIC and MBC values ranging from 1–2.5 µg/mL and 1.5–2.5 µg/mL, respectively. Hydrocarbon monoterpenes showed the lowest bacterial activity, while oxygenated compounds resulted in a higher potential, especially phenol type compounds such as thymol and carvacrol [

 <xref rid="B55-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. On the other hand, the oxygenated monoterpenes exhibit strong antimicrobial activity pronounced on whole cell, while hydrocarbon derivates possess lower antimicrobial properties, as their low water solubility limits their diffusion through the medium [

 <p>Our study investigated whether the chemical intensity and weight yield of essential oil fraction of 
  <italic>Zingiber officinale roscoe</italic> was significantly affected by variety, maturity stage or cultivated location in Sri Lanka. Two varieties, Rangoon and Siddha planted in two geographical locations of Sri Lanka were harvested at three maturity stages. Chinese variety was studied as the control. Study revealed that the ginger essential oil (GEO) weight yield decreased with increasing maturity stage. Maturity stage and location of cultivation was significantly affecting GEO weight yield while chemical intensities were significantly affected by maturity stage only. Variety factor was not significantly affecting any of the dependent variables. Interaction effects between factors suggested that Siddha and Rangoon were the best varieties to cultivate in Sri Lanka. Best time to harvest rhizomes was at 5 months maturity for any tested variety. 13 major compounds were identified in Siddha while 12 major compounds were identified in Rangoon. It was suggested that variety Siddha was better than Rangoon from its antibacterial chemical profile and composition.

<p id="p0055">Carbowax 20M capillary column in SHIMADZU GC analyzer was injected with 300 μl of essential oil in two splits. Chemicals were separated using nitrogen mobile phase gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Initial temperature of the packed column was 40 °C. Materials were eluted for 5 min in this temperature and increased rapidly up to 200 °C at a rate of increase of 6 °C per minute. Two holds first at 80 °C for one minute and second for 20 min at 200 °C. Separation was continued for further 20 min at 200 °C until all the materials were reasonably separated. Final chromatographs were obtained after 40 min. Flame ionization detector (FID) at a temperature of 300 °C was utilized as the detector for the measurement of intensities of chemical peaks (

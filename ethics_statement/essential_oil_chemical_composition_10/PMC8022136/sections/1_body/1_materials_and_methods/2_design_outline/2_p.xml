<p id="p0040">The protocols of all methodologies (procedures, experimental designs analysis assays) were adopted from earlier published work (
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Pellerin, 1991</xref>). Two varieties of 
 <italic>Zingiber officinale roscoe</italic> with a Chinese variety named “Chinese” as the control were cultivated in experimental plots of two potentially important ginger cultivating areas of Sri Lanka. Experimented varieties were Rangoon and Siddha. All varieties were planted in separate plots in two location strata. Cultivated geographical locations were at Makandura and Allawwa areas in Sri Lanka. Experimental plots were all similar in size. Similar fertilization, irrigation as well as amounts of solar radiation exposure was provided. All initially planted rhizomes were similar in size and age. Harvesting stages were 5, 7 and 8 months after plantation. Eighteen (3 × 2×3), variety-location-maturity stage combinations were sampled. Experimental design model utilized in this study was three factor factorial design.

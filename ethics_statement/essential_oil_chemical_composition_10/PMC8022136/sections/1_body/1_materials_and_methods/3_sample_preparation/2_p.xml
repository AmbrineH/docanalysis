<p id="p0045">Rhizomes of ginger were harvested, washed with distilled water. Skin of the rhizomes were peeled and were cut in to small pieces. Average thickness of a cut piece was 5mm while average length was 15mm. Cut pieces were mixed well to obtain a good representative sample. 40–45kg of wet sample per each variety-location-maturity combination was obtained and was taken to the laboratory for air drying (AD) in an oven at 50 ± 5 °C until the moisture content of ginger reached 10–12%. An optimum temperature of 50 °C was used for ginger rhizome drying to preserve as many volatile compounds as possible from losses by high heat (

Air drying (AD) technique was the best drying method identified after comparing with freeze drying (FD), microwave drying (MD), infrared drying (ID) and intermittent microwave and convective drying (IM&amp;CD) (

Final dried sample weight obtained was around 4–5.5 kg. Dried sample was packed in moisture tight 160-gauge polyethylene container with anhydrous silica gel and kept at 4 °C in the cold storage until further use.

<p id="p0095">Regarding GEO chromatograph of local variety Siddha, chemical compounds in areas A and B were decreasing in intensity with increasing maturity stage. In relation to area A, average all chemical peak intensity drop from 5 to 7 months was 66%. It was 97% drop from 5 to 8 months. In relation to graph area B, average all chemical peak intensity drop from 5 to 7 months was 42% while chemical intensity drop from 5 to 8 months was 98%. In relation to graph area C, average all chemical peak intensity increment from 5 months to 7 months was 48%. Considering all 25 major chemical peaks, a 72% average drop of intensity from 5 to 8 months was recorded. Maximum intensity peaks of areas A and B were reported at 5 months maturity. On the contrary, area C did not show any dramatic fluctuation. Maximum intensities of area C were reported at 7 months after planting. α –nerolidol in Siddha variety appeared in area C at 8 months of maturity which showed an unusual 15.8% abundance. Moreover, regarding GEO chromatograph of Rangoon, areas A and B showed maximum chemical intensities at 5 months maturity. Area C intensities remained relatively steady with increasing maturity stage. Considering all major peaks, a drop of average peak intensity from 5 months to 8 months was observed. In relation to chromatograph area A this value was 42%. In relation to area B it was 6%. Peak intensity drop in chromatographic area C was 12%. Rangoon variety planted in Makandura did not show dramatic peak intensity fluctuations as compared to Siddha variety planted in the same location. Then again, we suspect the difference in variation may be due to the genetics of the two varieties. Further, some compounds showed a decrease following an initial increment of intensity with time. This unusual fluctuation could be due to compound conversion to other structurally related compounds or expenditure of certain compound for cellular processes for a brief period of time.</p>

<p id="p0080">In chromatographs of the tested ginger oil, three high peak density areas could be identified in which contained the majority of high intensity peaks. These areas were unique to ginger essential oil typical chromatograph and the first observed area (A) was marked from α–pinene and ended with terpinolene, second observed area (B) was marked from citronellal and ended with geraniol as third observed area (C) was marked from methyl-iso-eugenol and ended with farnesal (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In both the varieties chemical peak intensity fluctuations in area C with varying maturity were different to the behavior of areas A and B. Area C peak intensities and relative abundance levels were either remaining steady or showing a slight increment with maturity.

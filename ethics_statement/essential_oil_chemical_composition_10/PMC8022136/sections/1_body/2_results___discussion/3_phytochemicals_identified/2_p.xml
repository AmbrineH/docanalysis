<p id="p0075">Twenty-five (25) chemical compounds were positively identified after analysis via gas chromatography followed by comparison with typical ginger essential oil chromatograph. Siddha variety accounted for 13 major compounds while Rangoon accounted for 12 major compounds. Compounds were more than 2% in abundance level. Nine compounds identified in Siddha variety such as α-pinene (7.2%), camphene (12.4%), β-phellandrene (12.4%), citronellal (12.4%), citral-a (8.3%), borneol (5.2%) β-sesqui-phellandrene (10.9%), β-zingiberene (5.7%), geraniol (6.7%) were more than 5% in relative abundance while seven compounds identified in Rangoon variety such as α-pinene (8.4%), camphene (13.6%), β-phellandrene (13.6%), citral-a (7.5%), β-sesqui-phellandrene (12.2%), α-zingiberene (9.7%), geraniol (11.8%) were also more than 5% in abundance level (

 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). However, in general, a trend of decrease in chemical intensity or abundance for almost all compounds in both the varieties were observed. In addition, highest intensities were observed at 5 months stage while lowest were observed at 8-month stage.

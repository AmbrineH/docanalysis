<p id="p0090">Based on the interaction plots (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>a and 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>b) the highest GEO weight yield and highest chemical intensities were recorded in the ginger rhizomes harvested at 5 months maturity. Rangoon and Siddha varieties showed high oil weight yields at 5 months maturity stage. Both these varieties recorded high weight yields when they were planted at Makandura geographical location in Sri Lanka. Interaction plots further demonstrated that Rangoon variety was the maximum producer of GEO when planted at Makandura area. Although Siddha variety showed the minimum GEO weight yield at Makandura it contributed to the maximum oil weight yield at Allawwa area. As different varieties respond variably to weather patterns and soil nutrient levels, it is suggested that Rangoon responded best to conditions in Makandura while conditions in Allawwa suited Siddha. Interaction plot (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>b) for chemical intensities in GEO showed that Siddha variety was better than Rangoon if harvested at 5 months maturity. In general, Rangoon variety showed very low chemical intensity variation with the maturity stages while Siddha showed a dramatic drop of chemical intensities with increasing maturity stage. Possible cause for this could lie deep in the genetics of the two varieties.

<p id="p0100">Maturity stage at harvest is a very important parameter to determine before harvesting ginger for industrial use. Different maturity stages of ginger rhizome would manifest variable weight yields and GEO chemical profiles. Prevailing knowledge was that at five-months maturity rhizomes were less fibrous and less in chemical intensity than that of seven to nine months matured rhizomes (

However, in this research we demonstrated that in Sri Lankan conditions, highest chemical intensity and GEO weight yields were reported by five-month matured ginger rhizomes. Rangoon variety reported the highest percentage yield of 3.36% by weight. Local Siddha variety did not record the highest extraction percentage as expected. Percentage weight yields decreased sharply after 5 months maturity. Moreover, maximum chemical peak intensities were also reported by five months old rhizomes rather than by eight months old rhizomes.

<p id="p0120">Monoterpenes such as α-pinene, β-pinene, myrcene 1,8-cineole, borneol, camphor, which possess a strong effect against microbial activity (

 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Knobloch et al., 1989</xref>) was found in Siddha GEO. These chemicals seem to limit the rate of diffusion of hydrophobic compounds through the lipopolysaccharide layer (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Burt, 2004</xref>). The dissipation of ion gradient lead to impairment of essential processes in the bacterial cell and finally to the cell's death (
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Ultee et al., 1999</xref>) Current research indicated that some of these monoterpenes were in high abundance in the Siddha GEO extract while other bactericidal compounds such as β-sesqui-phellandrene, farnesal, and eugenol were in high abundance as well. Therefore, the antibacterial potential can be shown substantial in Siddha variety than in Rangoon. Local Siddha variety further contained high fragrance chemicals in high abundance. These chemicals include geraniol, linalool and borneol (

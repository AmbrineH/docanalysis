<p id="p0070">GEO weight yield was highest at 5 months after planting and lowest at 8 months after planting. Weight yield was gradually decreasing with increasing maturity stage for all the varieties (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). This pattern of reducing weight yield was observed equally in all the variety-location combinations tested in this research. We suggest increased rate of production of fibrous matter in ginger rhizomes with maturity in Sri Lankan conditions could be a reason for this result. It implies that the rate of essential oil production is lower than the fibrous matter accumulation rate after 5 months. At five months maturity stage, maximum weight yield percentage per dried sample weight (3.36%) was recorded by Rangoon variety grown at Makandura. Lowest oil weight yield percentage (1.61%) at 5 months after planting was recorded by Siddha variety planted also in Makandura area. Maximum and minimum weight yields recorded a 79.1% and 63.1% yield drop respectively when they reached 8 moths of maturity. All the variety-location combinations in average showed more than 55% drop of weight yield when their maturity reached 8 months after planting. Therefore, decline of oil yield weight with maturity stage was highly evident. Statistical analysis on GEO weight yield using ANOVA showed that 
 <bold>p</bold> values for main effects ‘maturity stage’ and ‘location’ of cultivation was less than 0.05 at 95% confidence level (p &lt; 0.05). Statistical analysis further showed that factor interaction effects between maturity stage-variety, maturity stage-location and variety-location also had a p value less than 0.05 at 95% confidence interval (p &lt; 0.05). However, ‘variety’ factor had a 
 <bold>p</bold> value higher than 0.05 at 95% confidence interval (p &gt; 0.05).

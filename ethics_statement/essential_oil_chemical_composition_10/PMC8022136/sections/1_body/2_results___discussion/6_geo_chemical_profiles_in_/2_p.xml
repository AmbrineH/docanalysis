<p id="p0110">In Iranian grown ginger, β-sesquiphellandrene, Zingiberene, caryophyllene, ar-curcumene, farnesene were the major compounds in the chemical profile of GEO while α-pinene, camphene, borneol (isoboeneol), germacrene, eucalyptol, terpineol were the minor constitutes. Altogether ten chemical peaks were prominent in the chemical profile (

 <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic> grown in Ecuador had a different profile in which a sum of 70 compounds were identified. Six chemicals citral, geraniol (10.5%), neral (9.1%), camphene (7.8%), α-zingiberene (17.4%), α-farnesene (6.8%) and β-sesquiphellandrene (6.7%) were the most abundant in the chemical profile (

In Indian grown ginger, eighty total compounds were identified in the chemical profile and five compounds such as valencene (7.61%), zingiberene (46.71%), β-funebrene (3.09%) and selina-4(14), 7(11)-diene (1.03%) were the most abundant sesquiterpenes while four compounds such as camphene (2.59%), citronellyl n-butyrate (19.34%), β-phellandrene (3.70%) and α-pinene (1.09%) were the predominant monoterpenes above 1% abundant level (

In the current study, all major chemicals were more than 2% in relative percentage abundance which was higher than the lowest abundance level of the previously mentioned researches.

 <italic>Zingiber officinale roscoe</italic> rhizome extract comprises of a majority of chemicals responsible for various physiological and medicinal effects expressed on humans. These chemicals in essential oil extract of ginger are very important to humans in many ways. Phytochemicals such as eugenol, cineol, citral and sesquiterpenoids, such as bisabolene, farnesene and β-sesquiphellandrene found in ginger were shown responsible for antibacterial activity (

Compounds like zingiberine, camphene, ar-curcumene, citral, β-sesquiphellandrene, nerolidol and α-terpiniol were responsible for the overall flavor. Most intense flavor compounds in ginger were chemicals like linalool, citronellal, geraniol, neral, isoborniol, borniol and several newly identified compounds such as 2-pinen-5-ol identified as main fragrance factors in ginger oil extract. These compounds accounted for highest flavor dilution (FD) factor values (

A recent study on formation of anti-biofilms and antibacterial characteristics of ginger essential oil (GEO) had shown that inhibition percentage for bacteria tested were more than 80%. Presence of terpenes such as zingiberine, camphene, geraniol, farnesene, α-bisabolene, β-sesquiphellandrene, neral, linalool, citronellal, α-pinene and borneol were the reason behind antibacterial activity and anti-biofilm forming activity of ginger essential oil (

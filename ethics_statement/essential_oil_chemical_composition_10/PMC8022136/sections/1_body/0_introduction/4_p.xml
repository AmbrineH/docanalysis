<p id="p0020">Ability of ginger rhizome extract to work as medicinal materials was remarkable. They acted as antioxidants, anti-inflammatory agents, anti-carcinogenic as well as antibacterial agents. Antioxidant liver enzyme levels were elevated in mice after oral administration of 500 mg/Kg of GEO for 30 days. Consequently, super oxide dimutase levels, glutathione peroxidase enzyme levels and glutathione-S-transferase enzyme levels were also elevated suggesting ample antioxidant activity in liver tissue (

Moreover, anti-carcinogenic properties were shown to be present in ginger rhizome extract and demonstrated successful decrease in the incidence of cancer of the colon of mice. Carcinogenesis in the colon was controlled by ginger phytochemicals at initiation and post initiation stages of cancer (

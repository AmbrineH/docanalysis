<p id="p0035">In the Sri Lankan context, limited research had been performed to analyze weight yield variation or chemical composition variation on Sri Lankan grown ginger essential oil. Few researches exist in which various varieties cultivated in different geographical areas were subjected to analysis. Moreover, none of these researches were conducted to find out how the composition or the essential oil weight yield varied with maturity stage at harvest. Therefore, the importance of the current study in understanding chemical composition and weight yield variation was unequivocal. Weight yield and chemical composition variation on various varieties and various harvesting stages after cultivation is a very important factor; it is considered important in industries using ginger as a raw material. As lesser knowledge exists on this study area, it is difficult to make better judgment on the correct stage for harvesting for each product. As chemical components of ginger oil are used readily inside food industrial products, our study aimed to use the knowledge collected for many ginger-based food industries in Sri Lanka.</p>

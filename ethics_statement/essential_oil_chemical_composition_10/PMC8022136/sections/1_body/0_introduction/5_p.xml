<p id="p0025">Moreover, recent research regarding chemical composition or yield variation of 
 <italic>Zingiber officinale roscoe</italic> essential oil transpired that the weight yield and chemical composition of GEO varies with cultivated geographical location of the world. 
 <italic>Zingiber Officinale roscoe</italic> species grown in China confirmed 43 chemicals such as α-zingiberene, β-sesquiphellandrene, β-bisabolene, α-curcumene, α-bergamotene, and ar-turmerone identified as the most abundant chemicals. The GEO weight yield was 4.07% from the total sample weight (

 <italic>Zingiber officinale roscoe</italic> species cultivated within a totally different area of the world such as at Ghaziabad in India revealed 80 compounds in its essential oil. The oil weight yield percentage was 1.26% from the weight of the sample. Moreover, zingiberene, citronellyl n-butyrate, valencene, β-phellandrene, selina-4(14), 7(11)-diene and β-funebrene were the most abundant compounds. All these compounds were more than 1% in relative abundance. Zingiberene content accounted for a maximum 46.7% abundance (
